In many ways, we have benefitted from the time to plan and reflect, aware of the challenges and opportunities ahead. We hope to manifest and share Zena’s programs with you in 2021.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We are grateful to everyone from artists and scholars to individual supporters and funders who have supported Zena Zezza this year. We were especially fortunate to have received a grant from the Oregon Cultural Trust’s Coronavirus Relief Fund for Cultural Support which supported post-production of previous Dialogues event recordings, an upgrade of our website with O-R-G, and implementation of a new design and system for sending you news, offerings, and updates. An Oregon Arts Commission Small Operating Support grant and gifts from individuals and Zena members will provide crucial support to realizing our work in 2021.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Collaboration and partnerships with cultural and academic institutions are at the heart of Zena’s Artist Project Seasons. We are hopeful that the constraints of 2020 will be replaced with new opportunities for sharing ideas and resources with previous and new partners to expand engagement with our local communities and our national and international audiences. We are thankful for exhibitions, screenings, and dialogues with artists and guests from other fields that were made possible through collaborations with the Portland Art Museum/Northwest Film Center for Zena’s Chantal Akerman season and our 2019 Hans Coper: Less Means More season at the Oregon Jewish Museum and Center for Holocaust Education. Since 2016, Zena’s Dialogues events have been presented at the Pacific Northwest College of Art. While Zoom is on our minds for 2021, we also look forward to in-person gatherings, engagements with artists, and conversations that move us beyond this moment. We are enriched by the generosity of others and committed to sharing our resources.</div><div><br></div><div>A special collection of contemporary artists’ monographs, books, and editions has been donated to Zena to benefit upcoming Artist Project Seasons. The collection spans from the 1980s on and includes many publications from Europe, the US, and beyond. In this period of constraint, these publications can expand our points of reference and bring us closer to artists’ ideas and their work. Periodically, new selections will be added.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>ARTIST PROJECT SEASONS (2013-2019). Visit PAST to view the work, ideas, and engagement of a wide range of voices in Dialogues Events with artists:&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Josiah McElheny — Anthony McCall — Stan Douglas — Chantal

McElheny received a B.F.A. from the Rhode Island School of Design and was an apprentice to master glassblowers Jan-Erik Ritzman, Sven-Ake Carlsson and Lino Tagliapietra. A sculptor, performance artist, writer and filmmaker, McElheny’s work draws on his interests and research into the history of glass, modernism, the evolution of museological display, Enlightenment philosophy and early twentieth-century theories of utopia and the “Big Bang.” \r\n<br><br>\r\nIn 2012, McElheny completed major projects including “Screens for Observing Abstraction,” a meditation on abstraction in film throughout the 20th century, Whitechapel, London; “Some thoughts about the abstract body” focused on abstraction, fashion and the body, Andrea Rosen Gallery, New York, and White Cube, London; and a new film, The Light Club of Vizcaya – A Women’s Picture premiered at the Vizcaya Villa and Gardens in Miami. In 2013, “The Club for Modern Fashions” opened at the Arts Club of Chicago where performers wearing vintage fashions from the 1920s through the 1970s occupied the Mies van der Rohe inspired pavilion. He has exhibited widely including recent solo museum projects at the Wexner Center for the Arts, Columbus (2013); Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston (2012); Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid (2009); Henry Art Gallery, Seattle (2008 and 1999); Moderna Museet, Stockholm (2007); and the Museum of Modern Art, New York (2007). Recent books include “Towards a Light Club”published by Hatje Cantz for the Wexner Center for the Arts (2013); ”Some Pictures of the Infinite” published by Hatje Cantz for the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston (2012); “Prism” a monograph published by Rizzoli (2010); “The Light Club,” an artist’s book published by the University of Chicago (2010); and “A Space for an Island Universe” published by the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía and Turner Publications (2009). McElheny’s work is included in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; Tate Modern, London; Museum of Fine Art, Boston; Los Angeles County Museum of Art; Dallas Art Museum; Phoenix Art Museum; Seattle Art Museum; Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego; Yale University Art Museum and the Rhode Island School of Design Museum, Providence. He has written for Artforum and Cabinet, and is a contributing editor to BOMB. Since 2001 McElheny has been a senior critic in sculpture at the Yale School of Art and he is the 2013 Teiger Mentor in the Arts at Cornell University. In 2006 Josiah McElheny was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship. \r\n<br><br>\r\nIn inviting Josiah McElheny to be the first artist to produce an Artist Project Season in Portland, Zena is recognizing McElheny as an artist’s artist; a deep historical and cultural researcher who frequently collaborates with other artists and professionals across subjects and disciplines; a maker and master craftsman whose ideas are manifest in different media and ways over time; and in McElheny’s own words, an artist who “creates images as demonstrative of ideas that act as agents of persuasion for new ways of thinking.” \r\n<br><br><div><i>\r\nEVENTS &amp; RESOURCES\r\n</i></div><br>\r\nThe exhibition will be connected through a series of <a href=\"/past/josiah-mcelheny/events\">related events</a> in the space and elsewhere together with related materials compiled on this website including <a href=\"/past/josiah-mcelheny/reading\">readings</a>, <a href=\"/past/josiah-mcelheny/images\">images</a>, and <a href=\"/past/josiah-mcelheny/videos\">videos</a>.\r\n<br><br><br>\r\n\r\nAll images copyright Josiah McElheny.</div>',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(62,1,'2014-01-17 12:16:15','2020-11-24 01:31:59',1,'1a',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'1a',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','',NULL),(40,1,'2013-09-05 16:54:29','2020-11-24 01:31:59',100,'An Historical Anecdote About Fashion, 1999',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'an-historical-anecdote-about-fashion-1999',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'An Historical Anecdote About Fashion, 1999','',NULL),(34,1,'2013-08-21 21:07:14','2020-11-24 01:31:59',400,'Artists & Models',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'artists-models',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',_binary '<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/w-lFT7CCuT8?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>',NULL),(35,1,'2013-08-21 21:10:04','2021-05-20 10:18:02',1,'Events',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'events',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								',NULL,_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(29,1,'2013-08-21 16:12:47','2020-11-24 01:31:59',300,'Prints and the Pursuit of Knowledge',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'prints-and-the-pursuit-of-knowledge',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'On Prints and the Pursuit of Knowledge, Harvard Art Museum — \r\nJosiah in conversation with exhibition curator, Susan Dackerman ',_binary '<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/41088482?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>',NULL),(61,1,'2014-01-17 12:15:51','2020-11-24 01:31:59',2,'2',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','',NULL),(30,1,'2013-08-21 16:21:22','2020-11-24 01:31:59',310,'University of Chicago',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'university-of-chicago',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'University of Chicago \r\nNov 15, 2010 \r\nLecture\r\n',_binary '<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/26075806?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0&color=800000\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>',NULL),(58,0,'2014-01-17 12:03:56','2021-05-10 11:45:00',2,'Installation',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'installation',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Installation images','',NULL),(59,1,'2014-01-17 12:09:25','2021-05-26 20:35:25',8,'\"The Light Club\" at the lumber room',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'the-light-club-at-the-lumber-room',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Allison Cobb, Paul Mazier, John Shipley, Mary Sutton&nbsp;<br>',_binary 'Saturday, December 7, 6-9pm<br><br>\r\nDear Friend,<br>\r\nJoin the \"Light Club\" celebration of artist Josiah McElheny\'s season at the lumber room.

We were especially fortunate to have received a grant from the Oregon Cultural Trust’s Coronavirus Relief Fund for Cultural Support which supported post-production of previous Dialogues event recordings, an upgrade of our website with O-R-G, and implementation of a new design and system for sending you news, offerings, and updates. An Oregon Arts Commission Small Operating Support grant and gifts from individuals and Zena members will provide crucial support to realizing our work in 2021.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Collaboration and partnerships with cultural and academic institutions are at the heart of Zena’s Artist Project Seasons. We are hopeful that the constraints of 2020 will be replaced with new opportunities for sharing ideas and resources with previous and new partners to expand engagement with our local communities and our national and international audiences. We are thankful for exhibitions, screenings, and dialogues with artists and guests from other fields that were made possible through collaborations with the Portland Art Museum/Northwest Film Center for Zena’s Chantal Akerman season and our 2019 Hans Coper: Less Means More season at the Oregon Jewish Museum and Center for Holocaust Education. Since 2016, Zena’s Dialogues events have been presented at the Pacific Northwest College of Art. While Zoom is on our minds for 2021, we also look forward to in-person gatherings, engagements with artists, and conversations that move us beyond this moment. We are enriched by the generosity of others and committed to sharing our resources.</div><div><br></div><div>A special collection of contemporary artists’ monographs, books, and editions has been donated to Zena to benefit upcoming Artist Project Seasons. The collection spans from the 1980s on and includes many publications from Europe, the US, and beyond.

You once told me that sometimes you begin a work by responding to a story or an event and that during the course of this pursuit, something else  frequently comes up which overlays the piece. This was the case when your multi-part sculpture ISLAND UNIVERSE (2008) was installed in the Palacio de Cristal in Madrid. Siting the work in this historic building introduced a set of references to architectural traditions involving glass and its ideologies that had not been envisioned at the beginning of the project.&nbsp;<br><div><br>\r\nJOSIAH McELHENY: This takes me back to my piece FROM AN HISTORICAL ANEDCOTE ABOUT FASHION (2000), which began with a simple discovery I made while walking through an exhibition. Reading a museum label for a 1950s or 1960s year, I was surprised that it said the form was ased on a design by the workers, who were inspired by the dresses worn by the factory owner’s wife. That was so striking and I set out to make something more out of the story—something that, in a nod to realism, would remain faithful to the factory’s design aesthetics as well as to the fashions (in general) of that era. But it became immediately apparent that I would have to choose among many strains of mid-century fashion. While researching the period I kept coming across the phrase, the “New Look,” which originally comes from the American editor of Vogue. In a phone call (or cable) from Paris in the spring of 1947 to her Manhattan office, she said about Christian Dior’s first collection” “It’s the New Look.” I then found out that Dior’s fashion, this “New Look,” resulted in actual protests throughout the United States against Dior and then, paradoxically, widespread acceptance! Finally the term became a kind of catch-all for the return to optimism after the war. This seems to me a rare historical moment when fashion had found itself at the center of the cultural dialogue. So I thought I should attempt to meld, ad hoc, all of these unrelated, somewhat accidental and circumstantial notions, with my observation about an ostensibly minor event, building these associations into something larger.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLC: Did it ever occur to you that the wall label might be false or that it might be a disingenuous fabrication? Would it have mattered if someone had been playing games with the truth?\r\n<br><br>\r\nJM: Well, actually, you caught me because what the label really said—I told the story in “my” way—is that the vase was designed by the owner’s wife.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLC: Oh.\r\n<br><br>\r\nJM: A friend who had worked in the factory in the fifties told me that the label was not true. I pressed him on it, and he told me the name of the worker who had actually designed and made the vase. It all boils down to very strict class distinctions, to the idea that it was impossible for any factory worker to design anything. So the owner’s wife had to take credit for the design, for recognizing it as something good enough for the factory to produce. Even more surprisingly though, he told me that this sort of thing happened all the time; workers would go and see the latest couture in shop windows—he mentioned that he was particularly interested in Courreges—and then go right back to the factory and make something inspired by that at lunchtime. So you’re right,; it doesn’t matter whether the label is true or not. What’s important is that it’s completely unpredictable how ideas will move through culture and end up being expressed, how ideas will twist and sometimes eventually become something else altogether.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLC: The protests against the “New Look” in both the United States and France had to do with the vast amount of cloth it took to make Dior’s particular version of a ballooning skirt. This happened shortly after the war when rationing had only recently ended. In addition, the French government had continued to offer economic support for the couture industry (because of the jobs and manufacturing it stimulated) whereas the British and American governments did not support their fashion industries financially. So the French had an advantage in the marketplace. There was thought to be an ethical basis to the protests on both these counts. Looking to these vases, which are extraordinary luxury objects, and thinking about the factory owner’s wife’s dresses, remind us that today Dior’s look has ironically become the hallmark of the early post-war era. It has a look designed exclusively for the upper classes—though of course, there were replicas and knock-offs—and in that, essentially, it was about excess. Does your installation of refined glass vases pertain to this same luxury culture? Or is there a degree of ironic self-reflexivity? As we consider not only the vases but the way that you have chosen to display them, it’s hard to ignore the status of their prototypes.\r\n<br><br>\r\nJM: I think it is relevant that they are self-reflective and perhaps ironic. I found out later that the owner’s wife’s daughter believed I had missed the central point, which was that the factory workers hated their employer’s wife. I had depicted them as lusting after her, but they were Communists and she was the owner. And so these ironies, too, become part of the piece. This little history says something about the amorality of ideas. Once absorbed into other fields, even ideas with an ethical basis can become disconnected from their original morality, and thereby hopefully more generative. The notion that all ideas should retain their original moral structure is, on some level, dangerous.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLC: We have been reviewing this artwork in terms of luxury artifacts that belong to a particular history of design. What happens when we flip our perspective and start to think of it as sculpture? Should we now talk about the vases as non-functional objects? Thinking of them in sculptural terms introduces notions that don’t connect with the sorts of epithets we relate to luxury goods and their display. This is due to the relationship between categories of design and fine art, and the conventional hierarchies that subtend those categories.\r\n<br><br>\r\nJM: In the past fifty years, there’s been a huge increase in the number of people visiting art museums. But feeling connected to fine art is still confined to a relatively narrow band of society, whereas design—as a set of aesthetics that gets copied and repeated—influences all kinds of activities throughout society. Since the twentieth century, luxury goods are no longer the province of just the wealthy. They maybe be invented with the financial backing of the wealthy, but they inevitably get dispersed within society till they reflect the broad spectrum of all that is happening at the time.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLC: Within modernist design history, some of the best known early works came from the Bauhaus and similar groups who advocated a socially utopian role for design: they intended, or at least hoped, to better living standards by making works that would be available to a wide range of people. Venini glass belongs to a different history. Perhaps it depends on what kind of history one is writing, but I would not be inclined to place Venini in the same history as the Bauhaus, Charles and Ray Eames, and like-minded designers.\r\n<br><br>\r\nJM: It’s not unlike the field of art in the sense that there are so many trajectories and circles of art practice.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLC: In the histories of modernist art we prioritize radicality and innovation—whereas in design, the value of an object generally relates not only to its aesthetic but to its potential to be inexpensively mass-produced. This underlies, for example, the way we look at Bauhaus objects, like Wagenfeld’s glass designs. By contrast, when we look at Venini, we are confronted with an extraordinary level of craftsmanship and a realm of tremendous privilege, almost an haute couture of objects. Don’t we ultimately look at these artifacts in somewhat different terms?\r\n<br><br>\r\nJM: I would argue that our apprehension of these objects is almost always factually wrong—the truth is often the flip side of what we think. Aside from Breuer’s tubular metal furniture, most of what was designed at the Bauhaus was only produced in small quantities and never achieved any kind of broad influence until much later with Herman Miller or Knoll, or maybe now, with something like Ikea. Take Josef Hoffmann, for instance, whose work was made in small workshops that were located in the same building where he was designing them. Or Charlotte Perriand and Jean Prove, who also produced their own designs in very small numbers. I would be curious to know how many of Le Corbusier’s furniture pieces were really  made when they were initially designed. In Venini’s case where the production was definitely in relatively small numbers, it nonetheless involved a factory with multiple teams of five to eight people working in shifts. While there is an intense collaboration among skilled workers and a very high level of workmanship, the process still takes place inside a factory. Our typical assumptions and perceptions about these issues are quite mixed up and do not necessarily line up with the truth of how things are made, the truth of the circumstances of an object’s production.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLC: Would you agree that, at the current moment, there is a greater distance than usual between artists who have access to extraordinary resources for the production of objects (not only film and video or related technology-based works employing special effects) and more modest forms of production? Is there a wider spectrum now than there was, say, in the sixties? Compare the fabrication of Judd’s works in the sixties, which required a skilled set of people to produce, with an artist like Richard Tuttle, who was using the equivalent of cast-offs. And then consider the spectrum today. There seems to be an even wider division between, say, Matthew Barney and Olafur Eliasson, whose production  costs are very high, and others like Francis Alys and Joelle Tuerlinckx who, perhaps partly for ideological reasons, deliberately choose to limit the resources they utilize in any particular piece.\r\n<br><br>\r\nJM: We are now seeing a wider spread because society has a wider division of wealth between the working class and the upper class. But, on the other hand, it may not be so different: there were always artists who ended up gravitating towards highly sophisticated production. As Judd, for example, started to have more involved relationships with the people making and installing his work, it appears that the work became closer to how he really intended it to be. This is partly because he began making decisions in direct collaboration with specific people who were extremely knowledgeable about craft. But in order to do this he had to essentially take over a small metal working company. Similarly, Jeff Koons claims that his work has evolved to be more the way he wants it to be, but this has required immense monetary resources. So perhaps the scale has changed, buy the idea of utilizing expensive skilled fabrication techniques has not changed so much. From the opposite point of view I would argue that Matthew Barney—even though there is so much money necessary for his films—is deeply involved with his own studio in the making of his hybrid sculptural objects, both props and sculptures, and has an intensive relationship to them. The significant difference now results from true outsourcing—of artists claiming not to care how the work looks. “Here is a drawing. Come back with the finished version; however it turns out is fine.” This is a different development from the idea of building a support structure that allows one to get closer to the utopian goal of making an artwork look exactly the way it does in the imagination.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLC: Where does this situation leave painting? Whether a Susan Rothenberg or a Caravaggio, doesn’t it still comprise, ore or less, a piece of cloth with some colored dirt applied to it? Not only are the materials similar, but so is what it takes to acquire those materials and to work on them. Painting therefore seems to be in a totally different place from other art forms in today’s spectrum.\r\n<br><br>\r\nJM: The system of painting has not changed much since the Renaissance, but at that time it was actually incredibly difficult to produce a painting—to get the pigments, the labor, the commission to, let’s say, do a fresco or to pay for all the assistants it took to create a large history painting. But we have so much more wealth now and, at least in the West, we can leverage so much more labor than they could in the days of Rubens. You can get so much more “productivity” now for the same amount of money. There is an infinitely greater amount of material abundance now—paint and canvas (and time) are so much cheaper for us in Western society than they were back then. Painting sits in an economic situation that has a different relationship to history. In that sense the question of how it relates to production is a very old one.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLC: If you consider a shorter time span, a modernist history, does this situation change? Beginning with Manet, or better, with the Impressionists, painting has remained relatively unchanged in terms of scale of production: Picasso and Amy Sillman need more or less the same resources and amounts of stuff to make their works. With sculpture it may be similar. Given the fact that Rodin didn’t actually carve or cast his bronzes—his stone carvings were done by specialized craftsmen, as were his bronze casts—the scale and composition of his workshop and studio were not so different from some of those we see today, whether that of Koons or your own somewhat different situation.\r\n<br><br>\r\nJM: I would return to the idea that the economic and labor issues are not always what they appear to be. I believe that these are important questions because so much of the information about production that is visible within the artwork ends up becoming part of its content. We make a lot of assumptions from that information. Take, for instance, a Luc Tuymans painting. Part of our response to it involves a consideration of its modesty—even if we are mistaken about the work’s actual economic, labor, or production values.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLC: Does that mean that a certain pathos surrounds painting today?\r\n<br><br>\r\nJM: Well, yes, because a lot of these questions have to do with the idea of what we as individuals can do. Compared to other times in history, we don’t do very much. We have become so specialized that, as a result, we are severely limited in terms of what any of us can do. Painting, however, still represents something that we intuitively feel can be done by the individual. And in terms of sculpture, this constant question of what can be made by an individual or small group remains paramount even as production in the twenty-first century evolves further way from people. A hundred years ago, in this very spot where we’re sitting in Brooklyn, virtually every single everyday item would have been made within at two-or three –hundred mile radius, if not down the street. And that would have been true, more or less, in any other urban environment, but it’s absolutely not rue now.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLC: This seems compounded by the fact that, in many instances today, most of us can’t tell how something has been made. Nor can we precisely identifu its materials, nor can we understand the processes by which—especially with electronic goods—it functions. Perhaps that’s partly why we often savor things made by hand—painting included.\r\n<br><br>\r\nParkett 86 2009</div>',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(31,1,'2013-08-21 19:58:07','2020-11-24 01:31:59',400,'Videos',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'videos',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','',NULL),(32,0,'2013-08-21 19:58:45','2021-05-10 11:51:40',200,'Images',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'images',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',_binary '\r\n\r\nAll images copyright Josiah McElheny.',NULL),(33,1,'2013-08-21 20:01:02','2021-05-10 10:30:26',10,'Reading',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'reading',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(41,1,'2013-09-05 16:59:21','2020-11-24 01:31:59',200,'Bruno Taut on Mies van der Rohe (1922), 2009',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'bruno-taut-on-mies-van-der-rohe-1922-2009',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Bruno Taut on Mies van der Rohe (1922), 2009','',NULL),(42,1,'2013-09-05 17:01:07','2020-11-24 01:31:59',300,'White Modernism, 2008',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'white-modernism-2008',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'White Modernism, 2008','',NULL),(43,1,'2013-10-04 11:37:23','2020-11-24 01:31:59',1,'Artist Project Season works',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'artist-project-season-works',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',_binary '\r\n',NULL),(44,1,'2013-10-04 11:58:17','2020-11-24 01:31:59',1,'Artist Project Season works',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'artist-project-season-works',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',_binary 'Artist Project Season works.

His projects have often begun with handmade pieces of glass, created in his own studio. In addition, he creates films and performances that are important features of his exhibitions. Catalogue design, new translations of historical texts, and book publishing are also crucial parts of his work. It is difficult to sum up the artist’s practice in a sentence or two, but one can fairly say that altogether his art is motivated by an intense curiosity about the unrealized potential of utopian projects captured in the forms of objects. Described this way there is something potentially morbid about McElheny’s projects. He collaborates with the dead. With each new effort, he summons long-gone artists and the fallen artistic movements they founded. Through allusion, appropriation, and reconstruction, McElheny stages seances where deceased designers, artists, architects, crafts people, and writers hold court with living contemporary counterparts. Mixing together in the gallery, the dead and the living constitute an intentional community of participants spanning  generations, standing outside of time. \r\n<br><br>\r\nAs a way of starting our conversation, the day that we were scheduled to meet, I emailed Josiah a quotation from Elias Canetti’s Crowds and Power.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe essence of this fight between the living and the dead is that it is intermittent. One can never know when something is going to happen. Nothing may happen for a long time, but one cannot count on this; each new blow comes suddenly out of the dark. There is no declaration of war; after a single death everything may be over, or it may go on for a long time as in plagues and epidemics. The living are always on the retreat. Nothing is ever really over. \r\n<br><br>\r\nI have been thinking about the role of the dead in current artistic production for some time. I was eager to discuss this with Josiah because he is intensely preoccupied with the gate of modernism’s failed attempts and dead ends. Here, I understand modernism as the period of history—roughly from the mid-19th century to the present—in which artists made and make conscious attempts to directly encounter and alter aspects of technology and industrialization. McElheny continues the modernist project by catalyzing persistent (nagging) questions about art’s potential to counteract unjust social hierarchies. He seems to still believe that by changing the actual shapes of material forms—objects we can touch, hold, weigh, see, and see through—people can make a more tolerant society in which the bargain between laborer and industry is fair and honest. His method is retrospective. He tries to discover a novel way forward by casting backward to reconsider unfulfilled expectations of the past. This approach is very hopeful. In fact, I never experience his installations as macabre encounters with the dead. McElheny’s exhibitions are delightful and rich. But there is something threatening below the shiny surfaces. One gets lost in a detail only to take a step back and become overwhelmed by an excess of possibilities.<br>\r\n–Gregg Bordowitz\r\n<br><br>\r\nJOSIAH MCELHENY: The first moment I experienced an extremely deep connection to art was in Rome, where one cannot help observe the layering of history that you find there on any one street. Somehow that layering also makes historical artworks feel as if they are more connected to the present. Specifically I am remembering the intensity of seeing the Portrait of Pope Innocent X by Velazquez for the first time. I was amazed by the way the cloth of his gown was painted! As artists, we feel inherently connected to history because we all begin our understanding of art through the notion of its being a long trajectory. At some level, we’re all part of this, connected to it, even to things that might seem completely culturally divorced from our present day experiences. \r\n<br><br>\r\nI’m learning about history in my own blind way. There’s a certain modernist aesthetic that I find viscerally, bodily attractive. I understand that these kinds of aesthetics that physically attract me come from a certain place and from a limited set of ideas. And that’s what makes them powerful. A lot of those ideas, in terms of modernist aesthetics, come from an ideal of universalism. History has shown that universalism is a step away from totalitarianism—a deadly kind of erasure that I find horrifying. The rear of fascism undermines my sensuous relationship to those things. I often wonder, are there any other alternative aesthetics?\r\n<br><br>\r\nGREGG BORDOWITZ: Your investigation into alternatives often leads you to reinvent old objects, or reenact past events. Thinking about your work, and especially the new work that you’re doing on Paul Scheerbart and The Light Club of Batavia, I thought about the ghostly nature of the characters, specifically in the screenplay for a new film you are working on. \r\n<br><br>\r\nJM: Yeah, Paul Scheerbart was a high school dropout who moved back and forth between Dresden and Berlin. He became part of the café culture, a feuilleton writer. He wrote reviews on architecture and fine art, as well as some very strange short fiction in a format called the German Novelle. It is a short, schematic story that ends in an ironic twist. I’d seen Schererbart’s aphoristic book Glass Architecture, but I hadn’t had such a strong connection to it until I read the first English translation of a novel of his, The Gray Cloth, published in 2001. And in it, there’s a footnote to another very obscure story of his—one that’s not usually included in his bibliography—entitled The Light Club of Batavia. It describes the interactions of a group of socialites who meet at a hotel in Jakarta to build a spa in the bottom of a mine shaft and bathe in electric light. This story has led me to a whole series of explorations: performances, books, collaborations, and now this new film, called The Light Club of Vizcaya.\r\n<br><br>\r\nDiscovering Scheerbart has been very important for my work. His thinking about the future wasn’t totalitarian. He placed an emphasis on reimagination and failure. Scheerbart’s description of a future world was always a strange combination of, let’s say, Babylonian times and a science fiction future. He died in 1915, so all of his works are from the late 19th century and before World War I. You talk about ghosts—the more I learn about World War I, the more it seems to be the moment where history made this huge shift. What was possible to imagine before the Great War was no longer possible to imagine for a hundred years. It’s my hope that maybe in a small way, through art, we could return to this era, not nostalgically, but to actually find this broken path and pick it up again, keep going and keep asking questions abut it. Ultimately, what’s most amazing to me about Scheerbart is not that he had any answers, but that he was willing to propose things that had inherent conflicts. And he didn’t seem to be afraid of creating an almost absurd set of conflicting aims. I connect that to my own life experiences and the interior conflicts in my psyche.\r\n<br><br>\r\nGB: It seems to me that you work from a place of enthusiasm. I find your ability to be enthusiastic about the recovery  of utopian projects remarkable and sometimes vexing, given all we know about the trajectory of utopian projects in the 20th century. I don’t even know how to formulate this question except as a kind of psychological question. Where do you get your enthusiasm? Or do you think your optimism is just a disposition that you possess?\r\n<br><br>\r\nJM: It’s definitely a disposition, but my enthusiasm also comes through frustration. I would call myself talented only at one thing and that’s perseverance. I mean, I’m really stubborn. I’m willing to do something over and over and over again and discard all of it until it has some sense of being right to me. A lot of times when I’m trying to imitate the ineffable quality of some, let’s say, specific object from 1956, I fail at actually achieving a true facsimile or replica of it. Still, I try to capture some quality of the original object, some aspect of the atmosphere it came from—but for reasons of time, or money, or inability, I never fully succeed. I just have to be satisfied with something “good enough,” something that has at least some aura of the history the design came from. Ultimately, the ability to at least approximate something from the past is where my enthusiasm comes from. \r\n<br><br>\r\nBut our relationship to objects can constantly change. Something that looks wonderful can become awful and something that’s awful can become good. I try to make images of modernism that are attractive but that suddenly switch on you to become something else—perhaps the opposite of what you first perceived.  However, even then they might still evoke hope at some level. There’s a reason why people had utopian impulses. It’s not that utopia went wrong. Utopia encountered reality. Utopia encountered its own internal contradictions. It’s not that the will to improve life or to expand life is an inherently bad thing. And yet I’m really aware that so much terror and totalitarianism came directly from utopian thinking. I’m trying to understand it myself, but I don’t know what the alternative is. What do you think?\r\n<br><br>\r\nGB: I’ve traveled a long distance from my Frankfurt School roots, and I have very different ideas about the origins of totalitarianism in Enlightenment thinking. I spent a fair amount of time when I was younger believing that romantic enthusiasm would only lead down the road toward uglier passions. Within the last few years, I have come to question the assumption that strong emotions like enthusiasm or passion must be carefully controlled, or they will lead us inexorably toward our own sadistic impulses. That’s a hard thing for me to accept but I’m letting go of those past assumptions in my recent work. I feel that I’ve exhausted the method of critique that places limitations on certain emotional states. \r\n<br><br>\r\nSo, I respond positively to your enthusiasm but there’s a difference between you and me in the way that we think about history or histories. I don’t think there was only one modernism. I think that there were many modernisms and they were constantly competing with each other. It’s not possible to go back into the past and redraw the line of a trajectory so that it arrives at a different outcome. The linear trajectories that we’ve traced for ourselves as a way of explaining the horrors of the 20th century don’t exist as clear pathways. \r\n<br><br>\r\nI do agree that the past is always available to us to rearticulate. We can take ownership of the past for ourselves in the ways that you were describing. The dead are always around to remind us of their yearnings and we can respond by reevaluating and redoing, reperforming what we imagine as the actions and behaviours of people in the past. This won’t necessarily lead to our worst nightmares. I somehow feel irresponsible saying that because it challenges us to change the terms of well-worn debates concerning expressionism versus the anti-aesthetic. But that’s where I am right now.\r\n<br><br>\r\nJM: Right before 2000, I was working on this fashion project that focused on how ideas would move through and across class boundaries in very surprising ways. And that’s now come full circle to where I’m thinking about fashion again as a way of ideas moving through culture. But between those two periods, from 2000-2007, I worked on a series of projects where one of my main goals was the attempt to make an image of how the thing we are deeply attracted to can turn on us. For example, I reconstructed the space of the American Bar, which was built in 1908, the same year that the architect Adolf Loos gave a lecture that became his famous essay “Ornament and Crime.” The essay talks about the progressive development of society through the increasingly pure reduction of ornamentation. I thought, Well, what’s the end game with that?\r\n<br><br>\r\nI made an all-white version of this bar. White is the color of evil, in the sense of white as erasure. It allows for no color, no gradation, no dirt, nothing. And I made an all-white version of his essay, white letters on white vellum. Through great effort, I made this intensely bright, light space in which you would experience the bar, the barware, the bar sign and the essay. My assumption was that the viewer would go through a very simple process. (I always thought of display as a process, a performative thing.) First you would come into an all-white space that’s incredibly pristine. In theory, to a certain kind of person with a certain kind of upbringing, with a background like mine, it could be viscerally attractive, almost erotically attractive. And then I assumed another set of thoughts or feelings would follow. One would ask: “Where’s the color?” or “Where’s the dirt?” or ”Who cleans it?”\r\n<br><br>\r\nTo my disappointment, 90 percent of the people who experienced this work never got to that second, perhaps more critical, stage. They just thought, Wow, this is so exciting, and sensually beautiful. And I was really shocked by that. So, I spent the next few years trying to push this problem as far as I could in my work. I made Endlessly Repeating Twentieth Century Modernism, a cube of “infinitely” repeating modernist shapes. I assumed that anything that’s infinitely repeated is bad, right? Infinite repetition means that there’s no room for anything, there’s no room for me, you know? There’s no room for you. It’s just the thing endlessly repeated. Again, to my great disappointment, this kind of reflection was not the most common reaction. My idea is that art is a place where we can play and ask questions. And I still want to believe that. Unfortunately, when I think I’ve made a very clear demonstration of corrupt and dangerous ideas, I’m often unable to get people to stand in that critical spot with me. \r\n<br><br>\r\nGB: What’s changed the direction of my thinking in the past seven years or so, is an ongoing engagement with the philosophy of David Hume. (I was looking for an alternative to my own education, which focused on continental theory and French Hegelianism, either for or against Hegel.) Hume thought that it’s impossible for Reason to establish the necessity of causal relations. That’s an enormously humbling idea. We can’t be certain that simple causal relations will always result in the same effects. And so I think that it’s completely possible to pick up an object from the past and use it in ways with unpredictable results. I have hope in the possibility of different outcomes. \r\n<br><br>\r\nIn the past few years I also became very much interested in object relations theory and psychoanalytic theory. I’m very moved by the work of the analyst D. W. Winnicott. He described our developmental learning process as a process of finding the object through losing the object. Objects don’t exist for us until we’ve actually had them once, then lose them, and finally recover them. It’s only through the recovery of lost objects that objects become alive for the infant. This is a very hopeful theory and I think it is related to the methods you have for discovering objects, unearthing forgotten forms in the hope of discovering them anew. Novelty is a feeling. When you come across something exciting that appears novel, the object is not actually new—\r\n<br><br>\r\nJM: You are new!\r\n<br><br>\r\nGB: The sensation, the excitement is what makes you feel new.\r\n<br><br>\r\nJM: From our position in the postmodern world, we could imagine a future but we know our imagination of the future won’t be the future. Maybe in the modernist era you could imagine the future as the future. Still, even though we find ourselves in a very different position, people who have the privilege to present ideas in the public sphere have a responsibility to propose alternatives. And that doesn’t mean that they will be the alternatives that will become true. The proposal itself is something worthy and important; I mean a humble proposal with the awareness of its own limits. Just because the modernists made proposals for universal solutions that don’t allow for variation doesn’t mean that the very idea of offering proposals is wrong. Does it? Proposals are necessary, even it it’s just a moment that creates a sense of novelty about how we perceive the world. \r\n<br><br>\r\nGB: As I said before, I think that there are different modernisms and that the various modernisms have vastly different relations to historical materialism. And there are many different versions of historical materialism throughout the 19th, 20th, and now 21st centuries. So it’s hard to come up with one statement about the use or abuse of modernism in general. That’s why it’s productive to talk about the specificity of your working process. The critical strength of your work is comprehended through the particular methods you employ to display the unique objects that you produce. \r\n<br><br>\r\nJM: This could be a digression but I think it may be useful or interesting. I was working on a show in Stockholm, which was about the retelling of modernist history. And also about Scheerbart and the architect Bruno Taut, who was Scheerbart’s collaborator and protégé, in a way. The curator, Iris Muller Westermann, proposed that we retell the story of modernism, in part by correcting it—which I’m all for—by expanding it, by saying the truth: the first person to paint a purely abstract picture in the Western canon was not Kandinsky, but a woman, the Swedish artist Hilma af Klint. The curator invited me to co-curate a show of this artist’s paintings. It was a fantastic opportunity—we showed some of Klint’s works for the first time since the ‘20s. We cut a hole in the floor of the family foundation that cares for her work, in order to get out this incredible pyramidal, multi-colored painting, for example. Somehow they had gotten it in but the door was no longer big enough to take it out!\r\n<br><br>\r\nHowever, returning to your point about specificity, what’s been surprising and very encouraging is that the more specific I make something, the more it becomes something else. All these works that I have done that are essentially about the idea of postmodernity began with a piece called An End to Modernity. Maybe it’s a pompous title, but the idea is that both science and culture arrived, at almost exactly the same moment, at the realization that there are an infinite number of histories of the world. And that if we could actually observe from each of their specific viewpoints, we could see that they are all equally correct. \r\n<br><br>\r\nAnyway, I had the idea to make a sculpture, which eventually became An End to Modernity, in which every single aesthetic decision had a one-to-one relationship to the scientific information around the theory of the Big Bang, which postulates this infinite number of possible histories. I wanted to generate a sense of aesthetics that does not look random, nor systematized, and yet also doesn’t appear to be the product of a single mind. Even though the sculpture looks industrial, it’s not composed of repeated parts, which would seem to be the very definition of the industrial. It’s composed of individual arrangements of things, which defies the notion of efficiency, that is, modernity. I don’t expect that viewers get the very specific references that interest me, the specific scientific concepts. Rather, my goal was to infuse the sculpture with the scientific information in an absolutely accurate manner in order to create something whose biggest effect is uncanniness, or some kind of emotional response to its underlying, ineffable qualities. People I respect say they don’t necessarily see what I claim about my work in it, but they find something else useful for themselves. Maybe these works come from my own private dialogue, and their ultimate effect is something that I don’t understand.\r\n<br><br>\r\nGB: We’re getting to a point where I would expect you to address the topic of subjectivity and the role of subjectivity in art making. Actually, I can’t suspend that concern. For me, theories of subjectivity are central to the study of modernisms. I am inspired by the way Yvonne Rainer explores subjectivity in her films and choreography–through autobiography, through telling other people’s stories. Rainer uses quotations from personal accounts of the world and presents them through a variety of formal approaches. Her methods are primary models for me. I’m wondering where the role of subjectivity arises for you in what you refer to as modernism. In your discussion of modernism you emphasize its industrial character, its universalizing tendency, it multiplying potential. And you just talked about the way that you try to counter these aspects of modernism in your own work.  You brought up the idea of infinite possibilities, which reminds me of another central tendency within modernism, the singularity of point of view. Where is the place for identity politics that consider points of view along lines of gender, sexuality, race, or class?\r\n<br><br>\r\nJM: I began exploring the history of modernism through ideas around exhibition, display, and education. Those things are interrelated to me. My first works were quasi-educational museum structures. The first artwork I ever made—and I didn’t consider it a work at the time—was a museum that you would find in the forest by accident. It had both originals and fakes in it that I made myself.\r\n<br><br>\r\nNow with my current work, I ‘m trying to explore exactly what you’re asking about. Contemporary art history provides me with a new model for how to investigate subjectivity in some sense. I did a work in “collaboration” with the artist Allan Kaprow, after he was dead; I was commissioned to do this by his estate and the curator Helen Molesworth. But importantly, it was Kaprow’s idea that his work could be reinterpreted subjectively by others. My response to the request to make a new iteration of Karpow’s Yard, a work created from used tires, was to take a panoramic picture of a neighborhood full of used tires. It will be the last industrial urban redevelopment neighborhood in New York—where they tear down an old neighborhood and start from scratch. And then last year I was collaborating with another dead artist, Blinky Palermo. I was trying to imagine what it would be like if he came to a certain place today with the same attitudes and emotions and feelings as he had, let’s say, in 1970. I worked with two of the most important Palermo scholars, Christine Mehring and Susanne Küper to get as much information as possible about his working methods, in order to test this theory of mine. Palermo proposed a kind of unexplored trajectory within “minimalist abstract conceptual art,“ in which the point is not to create a situation where a conceptualization is presented to the audience, but where the conceptualization is actually there to create the possibility of the audience experiencing something themselves. So instead of the artist saying “I was here,“ a structure is set up to create the possibility for the viewer to say, “I am here.”\r\n<br><br>\r\nSo in Palermo’s idea of responding to space as a conceptual structure, he starts by measuring, using a dimension of the body—basically a hand’s breadth. For Palermo, each gesture was a subtle response to the space he occupied. He created straight lines, using a spirit level and 90-degree right angles, that always ended up diverging from the building itself. So basically the work is constantly showing the shift from the theoretical space of the architecture—its theoretical perfection—to the actual misaligned, imperfect angles that all buildings evidence. He was saying that ideas have to respond to the space the body is actually in. I think he wanted the viewer to think, Oh, I am in this specific space; and this specific space, if you take measure of it, has a peculiar set of qualities. It’s different than Sol LeWitt, who worked during exactly the same historical period as Palermo. LeWitt, said “Take a wall, any wall, divide it in half.” And, to me, that’s a way of obviating subjectivity. It could be any wall. It doesn’t matter where the wall is. The cultural situation of the wall doesn’t matter. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThat relates to what my last show at Andrea Rosen Gallery was about, using abstraction as a way of imagining a new body. How did you see that show?\r\n<br><br>\r\nGB: I saw it as a very hopeful gesture. When I was walking through the exhibition I wondered if you imagined that it was possible through plays of abstraction to call to mind new configurations of gender. So yeah, I agree with you that the show held out the possibility of reimagining bodies, other people’s bodies, and body shapes, by reflecting on one’s own image of the self. We could continue this line of thought, but I’m mindful of the time and I want to ask one more question. You’ve talked about Scheerbart, Palermo, Kaprow, and others. How would you characterize your relationship to the dead? You seem to have a number of lively conversations going on with deceased artists. \r\n<br><br>\r\nJM: This goes back to your saying that, in a way, the dead aren’t dead, they live on through us. I think the idea of being haunted is something that runs through all of my work. Remembering itself is a kind of haunting. I often find it funny when people say that a sculpture is mute. Its very presence indicates how the thoughts of others persist. I don’t understand people who want to make “new” things, because it seems that if you intend to make something new you’re just going to reinvent something somebody else made before without knowing. It’s like saying that you make something only for yourself, without regard to what others have done. But when you create something that can outlast oneself, you’re creating a kind of, I don’t know, good ghost. It’s possible that an artist might add one more idea, one more permissive idea that could haunt the world in a positive way. That’s not my goal necessarily, bit it could be a pretty good outcome.\r\n<br><br>\r\nGB: You don’t believe that you can make something new. Do you believe that you can produce novel emotions? \r\n<br><br>\r\nJM: I would propose that one of the main purposes of life is to learn how to give and receive love. To do that, the past must be re-inhabited and reenacted. Just because something has been done once can’t mean that it doesn’t need to be done again. Perhaps, repetition can’t be avoided. I believe that doing is worthwhile, in the way the pragmatists understood learning through doing. I don’t mean doing without criticality or self-awareness. One can certainly evaluate the usefulness of the activity. I guess we’ve returned to the subject of enthusiasm. \r\n<br><br>\r\nGB: It’s interesting to start with modernism and end with love, because love is the one project that every individual must repeat and repeat in spite of previous failure or disappointment. It’s a matter of psychological survival. \r\n<br><br>\r\nJM: To close, I want to return to the topics of subjectivity and gender. Considering the current historical moment we’re living in, there’s one thing that gives me some hope—the beginnings of a deep change in our society’s ability to recognize an individual’s potentiality and right to determine their very own bodily psychic identity. I think that’s why I’m excited about the idea of combining abstraction with subjectivity. I hope it’s worthwhile to try to create new examples or manifestations of permissive, subjective thinking. My recent exhibition at Andrea Rosen Gallery was trying to do that. But I had a fear about the “Walking Mirror” pieces I constructed for this show. I was concerned that they would feel like a total erasure of the performer who was wearing them. So I asked the performers to improvise with them. But to my complete surprise, they became instead these absorptive bodies because while they were moving through space, the viewers saw themselves completely reflected in them. It’s as if they had absorbed you (the viewer). It seems I have moved from questions of display and education to the questions we’ve just discussed—How does subjectivity change historically and how are we changed by newly developing subjectivities?\r\n<br><br>\r\nBOMB 121/Fall 2012\r\n',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(46,1,'2013-10-04 12:54:35','2021-05-25 21:09:50',NULL,'Nowhere, Everywhere, Somewhere',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'nowhere',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Josiah McElheny\r\n																								\r\n																								',_binary 'Photographs and drawings for the very first glass-clad skyscrapers were originally published in the summer of 1922 in the last issue of Bruno Taut’s short-lived journal Fruhticht. They depicted two designs by Mies van der Rohe: his unsuccessful 1921 competition entry for a site on Berlin’s Friedrichstrasse, and the “Glass Skyscraper Project” of the following year. For the latter, he built a model with glass panels for use in his ongoing studio experiments with illumination and refraction.&nbsp;<br><br>\r\nArchitectural models typically include contextualizing elements: a city plan often presents us with abstracted, minimal representations of buildings that already exist on the site or imaginary buildings that might be built later. The lack of delineation is intentional. In order to not distract from the grandeur of the new design, Mies’s “Glass Skyscraper Project” was different. He created a series of photographs where the skyscraper model was situated amid two rows of detailed-if stylized-imaginary historical buildings. Some images even depict the skyscraper outdoors, set among real trees and sky.\r\nIn the Museum of Modern Art catalogue accompanying the 2001 exhibition “Mies in Berlin, “ a hand-tinted print of one of these photographs is accompanied by a caption that states, “Glass Skyscraper Project-no intended site known.” Current research strongly suggests that Mies did not intend for the photographs to be understood as portraying a particular place; the model was intended as a proposal for a new theory of light in architecture. Yet Mies took the unusual step of placing his design in what appears to be a real site, replete both with history and evocations of nature. The caption that the catalogue gives the project seems to imply that it is for no place. This impression is paradoxical. The thirty story building clearly stands in a somewhere, and yet that somewhere is considered a nowhere. <br>\r\nThe tower inhabits some kind of square, and the structures around it—made in the form of one-sided plaster facades by the Expressionist artist Oswald Herzog—are obviously intended to depict what would have been considered old buildings, even in 1922. It is a choice that creates an undeniable sense of place. To some, these scale buildings appear to be specific houses in a specific city or town; there have been repeated efforts to identify them. The oral histories related by Mies’s collaborators suggest that the buildings are an amalgam of architectural memories, and so create an undeniable sense of the familiar. A Haspburg-era square? A nineteenth-century northern European street?\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe purpose of Mies’s gesture has generated a fair amount of scholarship of late, but also makes a simple statement: it seems he, at least briefly, imagined his new modernist vision existing not in a completely remade world, but in a world in which both the architectural past and nature were acknowledged. Most famous skyscraper cities, like New York, have become what they are by progressively replacing their historic architecture with ever-taller buildings. With very few exceptions, truces between the new and the old rarely seem to last. Here in Mies’s images we see what such a truce might have looked like. Here is a modernism that is not everywhere, only somewhere. <br>\r\nEverywhere soon became the paradigm. The year 1922 also witnessed Le Corbusier’s “Contemporary City,” and by 1925 he had introduced Plan Voisin, his proposal to raze entire neighborhoods and replace them with endless rectilinear housing blocks. While never built, this became a model for housing worldwide, much of which was a social disaster and ultimately a failure. But this new everywhere always seemed to require—or at least hoped for—a complete erasure in order to begin. Mies joined in with the program and before long we had a modernism that, in tandem with Taylorism and Fordism, could be implemented from China to Chicago, Moscow to Berlin—a modernism that was both everywhere and nowhere because it erased any somewhere that was already there. In the rare cases where people successfully objected, a solution was soon found: conquer the farmland and forest at the edge of the cities to create the concrete suburb. In either case from the cities of France to Cabrini Green in Chicago, social disaster ensued. \r\n<br><br>\r\nMies is remembered to have said that the historical buildings surrounding his model were meant to be “hideous” housing: and the current trend among scholars is to describe them as decaying, caricaturist, “medieval” structures and connect them to architectural depictions in contemporaneous Expressionist films about horror and decrepitude, such as Robert Wiene’s 1919 “Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,” Paul Wegener’s 1920 “Golem, “and F. W. Murnau’s 1922 “Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror.” This comparison is in perfect concordance with Mies’s own notion at the time: that the existing buildings in Berlin were a debased form of architecture. The critical interpretation reflects Mies’s own stated prejudices and perceptions, but do they also reflect our own? Looking at the sculptural models in the photographs without actively trying to imagine them as a horror movie set, the buildings seem more childlike than terrifying, more playful than neglected. In these visual experiments, as much as the skyscraper dominates the other buildings or trees and sky—as was perhaps Mies’s conscious intention—it is also humanized by their presence, offering us a familiar pre-modern anthropomorphic scale. Perhaps this disjunction between stated intention and result is indicative of a repressed impulse within Mies’s vision. Today it is more important to look for instances, however weakly expressed, where reconciliation with the environment might have been possible, rather than reinforce Mies’s declarations of disgust towards the existing historic world around him. In analyzing the past in light of our belated realization that resources are inherently finite, we need architecture to resurrect the modernist hope for new ways of living, but outside the confines of the economic ideology of “creative destruction.”\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe unusual nature of these photographic studies suggests “”revisionist” questions: What if Mies were actually calling for the integration of new structures with the old? What if he were pointing to a modernism that acknowledged the architecture of the past as being compatible with—perhaps even enriching—the new modernism of technology, capital, and political “efficiency?” What if he were proposing an alternative to the erasure of the past, the clearing of the obsolete, the violent starting anew that modernism proposed and enacted? What if instead of a post-modernism that simply borrowed forms from buildings often long ago demolished or discredited, there had been all along an accommodation between the modernism of the new and the architectures of the past? What if they had been viewed as compatible, instead of fundamentally opposed?<br>\r\nWhen Mies created these photographs, it was not yet clear what would soon happen, how perfectly the modernist project would suit the needs of the developing economic and political situation, and how this alliance would decimate the old. The “Glass Skyscraper Project” is a proposal that—despite Mies’s efforts to demonstrate domination—provides a slender hope for accommodation. It presents a literal juxtaposition of the new and the old, a model for coexistence with history. The political implications of this idea that perhaps the modernist project could have developed in a situation of a somewhere, while perhaps fanciful, might also be far reaching. People’s identity is always formed by place. Perhaps these little experiments of Mies’s can function as a reminder of how plans for a new world almost always seem to forget that everywhere and nowhere do not exist, cannot exist. Everything and everyone resides in a somewhere.\r\n<br><br>\r\n1 Because of its baroque and at the time unrealizable nature the “Glass Skyscraper Project” represents the only moment when Mies can be connected with the more spiritual and romantic leanings of Taut and his colleagues. Taut’s group, the Crystal Chain had in the previous few years developed a manifesto for a new fantastical architecture that promised a politicized but quasi-spiritual experience for the common worker. Mies’s rejection from the 1919 Austellung fur unbekannte Architekten (Exhibition for Unknown Architects)—sometimes soon as a precursor for the Crystal Chain—and his subsequent decision to submit the proposal to Taut’s journal are significant in this light. For more on this see Iain Boyd Whyte, Bruno Taut and the Architecture of Activism (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1980) and Mertins, op. cit.<br>\r\n2 Terence Riley &amp; Barry Bergdoll, eds Mies in Berlin (New York: Museum of Modern Art, 2001), pp. 186-187.\r\n3 See Spyros Papapetros, “Malicious Houses: Animation, Animism, Animosity in German Architecture and Film—From Mies to Murnau,” in Grey Room, no. 20. Summer 2005, pp. 6-37, and Detlef Bertins, “Architectures of Becoming: Mies van der Rohe and the Avant-Garde,” in Mies in Berlin, op. cit., pp. 106-133. There has been speculation that the facades depicted in the photographs were modeled after contemporaneous buildings on Friedrichstrasse, the site of Mies’s earlier project, but comparison with period photographs of the avenue does not bear this out. In fact according to Werner Graef, Mies’s former assistant, Herzog recounted that Mies instructed him: “Make me a piece of Friedrichstrasse as it once was; it does not have to be exact, only in principle.” (Papapetros, op. cit., pp. 19 and 24).<br>\r\n4 According to Mertins, there is no general agreement on a source model for those buildings (email correspondence with the author). Beyond literal identification, scholars have interpreted the classification of the surrounding buildings variously; some, like Michael Hayes (in email correspondence with the author), have suggested that they might be Biedermier, while others like Graef, have compared them to buildings by Mies’s former teacher, Peter Behrens.

From indigo blue to the event of a thread, she has created installations that bring together sensory landscapes with performance, crafting spaces and outfits for her works’ participants that investigate the line between objects, subjects and bodies. In relationship to Josiah McElheny’s work, which culls from modernist narratives constructed around sartorial fashion, Hamilton and scholar Jessica Burstein will address what it may or may not mean for the body to be abstract when it comes to fashion. While McElheny invokes writers, artists and couturiers—Dior’s New Look, Scheerbart’s “Grey Cloth,” Sonia Delaunay, Oskar Schlemmer—Hamilton turns to equally embodied, but differently arrayed, sources: Anni Albers, Walt Whitman, Ralph Waldo Emerson. Conversational topics may range from how the human form can be or refuse to be a machine; the role of prosthesis; avant-garde approaches to the sartorial (the Bauhaus, Futurism, Constructivism); and clothing and/as history.\r\n<br><br>\r\nScreening: Oskar Schlemmer\'s \"Triadic Ballet\" will follow the conversation.&nbsp;\r\n<br><br>\r\nAnn Hamilton is an artist based in Columbus, Ohio. A visual artist internationally recognized for her large-scale multi-media installations and immersive experiences, Hamilton’s material and methods of making serve as an invocation of place, of collective voice, of communities past and of labor present. She represented the United States in the 1991 Sao Paulo Bienal and the 1999 Venice Biennale, and her recent museum installations include Park Avenue Armory (2013); The Pulitzer Foundation for the Arts, St. Louis (2010); The Guggenheim Museum, New York (2009); and Contemporary Art Museum, Kumamoto, Japan (2006).

Her book, Cold Modernism: Literature, Fashion and Art, engages writers and artists including Henry James, Virginia Woolf, Coco Chanel, Balthus, Hans Bellmer, and argues in part for the aesthetic virtues of taking surface appearance seriously.

Within the space of the exhibition, “If you lived here, you’d be home by now” at the Bard Hessel Museum of Art, Cooke and McElheny each brought a quote as a starting point to their conversation, “Dialogue.” Within the context of the lumber room and its history as the domestic space of art collectors—Josiah McElheny’s Artist Project Season provides a unique situation for an expanded conversation on “Interiors.”\r\n<br><br>\r\nCOOKE: In 1930, when she [Hilla Rebay] and Solomon Guggenheim were beginning to plan the public presentation of his collection of abstract art, Rebay argued, “Anyone who hopes to fully comprehend a picture has to live with it… The exhibition room needs to be solemn yet comfortable enough that one is forced to linger.” Rebay wanted a situation that promoted great concentration and so furnished the galleries of the interim presentations of Guggenheim’s collection in New York City with curtains and carpet, played recorded music by Bach and Beethoven, and provided seating in the guise of low ottomans; ottomans low enough to make one aware of the tug between body and spirit, between gravity and weightlessness. \r\n<br><br>\r\nMCELHENY: In an interview in 1974, William Rubin remarked, “To the extent that it remains within the tradition of modern easel painting, [art] still finds the museum a hospitable environment, although the ideal place—even for a big Pollock—is in a private home. I think that’s what most modern painting, given its character, really wants. To me, museums are essentially compromises. They are neither like a really public place nor are they private—like an apartment. Their weakness is that they are necessarily homogenized—emptied of all connotations other than art, and that finally is an artificial situation.” Rubin concluded, “Museums never were, and I think never will be, the absolutely right environment for works of art. I don’t think works of art are at their most interesting when separated from the whole fabric of life.” \r\n<br><br>\r\nJosiah McElheny is an artist based in New York City.

THE FILMS OF CHANTAL AKERMAN 1968-2015\r\n\r\nLOOKING, REALLY LOOKING! The Films of Chantal Akerman 1968-2015 is a film and performative program which surveys the work of the Belgian/French filmmaker Chantal Akerman and places it within a conceptual, thematic and historical context at the intersection of film and contemporary art. Seen in historical and avant-garde circles from the US and Western Europe to the Middle East and South America, Akerman’s films move across genres from the documentary/essay to the musical and multi-media installations and are often referred to as feminist, queer or Jewish. Akerman (1950-2015) presents us with complexities and doubts in an oeuvre that spans nearly fifty years and revolves around her family history, identity, memory and displacement, often portrayed in lengthy observations within the modest aesthetics of everyday life. \r\n\r\nAkerman created 40-plus films most of which have never before been seen in Portland and rarely on the west coast, nor her work deeply discussed. LOOKING, REALLY LOOKING! is not a chronological survey but rather an ideas-based approach which brings each chapter of the program into a series of performative conversations and events in Zena Zezza’s Dialogues series. Akerman\'s seminal first film \"Saute ma Ville\" (1968), influenced by Jean-Luc Godard’s \"Pierrot Le Fou\" (1965), will be shown alongside \"Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles,\" a film which chronicles a woman’s domestic routines and which Richard Brody of The New Yorker called “one of the most original and audacious films in the history of cinema.” \r\n\r\nAkerman’s documentary/essay films led her to diverse landscapes and geo-political contexts from Mexico to the Middle East and American South in films including \"De l’autre cote\" (From the Other Side), \"NOW\" and \"Sud\" (South) influenced by the literature of William Faulkner and James Baldwin. Her production moves from silent films to re-imagined musicals and to portraits of artists including Franz Schubert, Pina Bausch and cellist Sonia Wieder-Atherton. In New York in the early 1970s, Akerman intensely watched avant-garde filmmakers Michael Snow, Jonas Mekas, Yvonne Rainer and Andy Warhol, and her earliest films were influenced by Jean-Luc Godard. Directors like Gus van Sant, Todd Haynes, Sally Potter and Michael Haneke have credited her as a major influence. J. Hoberman, film critic and contributor to Artforum, called Akerman “arguably the most important European film director of her generation.” \r\n\r\nChantal Akerman\'s work has been shown in major museums from the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis to Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; in major international film festivals from Toronto to Vienna; in and in international exhibitions including Documenta X and XI in 1997 and 2002 and the 49th and 56th Venice Biennales in 2001 and 2015.  She won special mention in the Nuremberg International Human Rights Film Festival Prize (2001); was nominated for the Best Documentary Film in the Cesar Awards, France (2007); and won the Bielfeld Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau Film Award and the EDA (Excellent Dynamic Activism) Female Focus Award (in memoriam) from the Alliance of Women Film Journalists (2015). \r\n\r\nAkerman\'s films have recently been the subject of surveys presented by the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York and in a Los Angeles-wide survey which took place at six institutions including Redcat, LA Film Forum and Fahrenheit. Presciently, Nos Amours, a London-based film collective, undertook a two-year survey of Akerman’s films at London’s Institute of Contemporary Art in 2013-2015 and presented seven installation works at Ambica3 Gallery in early 2016. \r\n\r\nLOOKING, REALLY LOOKING! is curated by Sandra Percival, Zena Zezza, and produced in collaboration with Morgen Ruff, Programmer, Northwest Film Center, Portland Art Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\nFILM SCREENINGS (see Film Screenings for dates, details and descriptions)\r\n\r\nLOOKING, REALLY LOOKING! The Films of Chantal Akerman commenced with a pre-program summer introduction to Akerman\'s work and continued through fall/winter 2016. The final segment of the program takes place March through May 2017. *See Film Schedule.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVENTS & RESOURCES\r\n\r\nThe film screenings are the starting point for DIALOGUES, a series of performative conversations on the ideas and influences within Akerman’s work, that bring together theory, scholarship and artists\' practices within the space of the exhibition. Dialogues events engage art and film historians, artists and filmmakers, writers, curators, musicians and guests from other fields.\r\n\r\nDIALOGUES series continues through May 2017. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n',NULL),(186,1,'2016-05-15 19:01:53','2020-11-24 01:31:59',2,'Events',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'events',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Events','',NULL),(187,1,'2016-05-15 19:02:14','2020-11-24 01:31:59',2,'Reading',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'reading',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Reading','',NULL),(188,1,'2016-05-15 19:03:02','2020-11-24 01:31:59',3,'Images',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'images',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Images','',NULL),(107,1,'2015-05-19 20:32:34','2021-05-28 16:16:35',2,'#2 — Anthony McCall',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'anthony-mccall',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								October 19, 2014 – February 28, 2015',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								<div>October 19, 2014 – February 28, 2015<br></div><div><br></div><div>The third season of programming is at the historic <a href=\"https://www.emerick-architects.com/hallock-mcmillan/\">1857 Hallock &amp; McMillan</a>.<br></div><div><br></div><div>\r\nAnthony McCall first exhibited on the west coast in 2007 with a solid light installation, \"You and I, Horizontal\" (2005) at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and \"Four Projected Movements\" (1975), a solid light film performance, at New Langton Arts. Neither before nor after this first exposure to McCall’s work has he been shown on the west coast and, overall, little in the US.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAnthony McCall was born in St Paul’s Cray, England in 1946 and he lives and works in New York City. McCall studied design at Ravenbourne College of Art and Design, London (1964-1968). In the early 1970’s through to the end of the decade, McCall was part of early structuralist and experimental cinema circles in London, moving to New York in the early 1970s alongside his then partner Carolee Schneemann where he was connected to Happenings, Fluxus and the Judson Street Dance Theater. Unusually, he had a nearly 25 year hiatus from the end of the 1970s, until his inclusion in the Whitney Museum of American Art’s exhibition, \"Into the Light: The Projected Image in American Art 1964–1977\" in 2000.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe exhibition presents McCall’s digital solid light installation, \"You and I, Horizontal II\" (2006) in the historic 1857 Hallock and McMillan. Stripped backed to its origins, the installation returns McCall’s work to the derelict and dusty old spaces in which he first presented his early solid light films in London. In the front room is \"Miniature in Black and White\" (1972), one of only two slide projector works McCall made as a form of filmic experience. The viewer stands in front of the slide projector gazing at a small screen immediately in front of the projector lens with 80 slides moving at one slide per second, forcing the slide carousel into the action of a film strip.\r\n<br><br>\r\nMcCall has redefined the boundaries between sculpture, film, performance and drawing, and between the viewer and the work. Pre-dating his solid light films were a series of durational \"Fire Cycles\" performances (1973-74) in expansive landscapes that lasted 12-13 hours. His first and most well-known solid light film, \"Line Describing a Cone\" (1973) reversed cinematic convention, transforming the space into an immersive field—viewers walk into the shifting cone of light and are incorporated into the film. Recent publications on McCall’s early work are repositioning his drawings, performances and film works with scholarship and writing by George Baker, Hal Foster, Brandon W. Joseph and Anne Wagner. \r\n<br><br>\r\nAnthony McCall’s work has been seen in major exhibitions internationally, including The \"Complete Cone Films\" in The Tanks, Tate Modern, London, and \"Five Minutes of Pure Sculpture\" at the Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin,  both in 2012. Since then, his work has been presented in prominent museums in Europe, North America, New Zealand, Tasmania, South America and the United Arab Emirates. McCall\'s work is in the permanent collections of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Musée National d’Art Moderne, Centre Pompidou, Paris; Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary, Vienna; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; Tate, London; Moderna Museet, Stockholm; and Musée d’Art Contemporani de Barcelona. He is the recipient of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship in 2008 and the Marie-Josi-Prize of the 5th International Experimental Film Competition in Knokke, Belgium in 1975.\r\n</div>',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(108,1,'2015-05-19 20:35:11','2020-11-24 01:31:59',1,'Events',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'events',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Events','',NULL),(109,1,'2015-05-19 20:35:47','2020-11-24 01:31:59',2,'Reading',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'reading',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Reading','',NULL),(69,1,'2014-11-09 20:43:09','2020-11-24 01:31:59',1,'Stan Douglas',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'stan-douglas',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Stan Douglas',_binary 'SEASON #3 — STAN DOUGLAS\r\n\r\nThe third season of programming is at the historic 1857 Hallock & McMillan\r\n\r\nStan Douglas was born in Vancouver B. C. where he lives and works. Douglas studied at Emily Carr College of Art, Vancouver. A conceptual artist, Stan Douglas uses film, video, photography, slide projection, music, literature, and, most recently, theatre to construct subtle and layered meditations on history and cultural identity. A passionate reader and devoted researcher with wide interests, Douglas understands history as a string of contingencies, marked by a fascination with those moments when historical events might have taken a different turn. In posing questions about particular locations or events, he constructs local histories in the guise of newly imagined narratives. \r\n\r\nWorking within the language and vocabulary of pre-existing mediums including silent film, news broadcasting, musical entertainment, television programs and the theatre stage, Douglas is well-known for a body of film and photographic works including \"Hors Champs\" (1992); \"Der Sandmann\" (1995); \"Journey Into Fear\" (2001); \"Cuba\" (2004); \"Midcentury Studio\" (2010); and his six hour film, \"Luanda Kinshasa\" (2014). Opening in Canada in 2014, \"Helen Lawrence\" launched Douglas’ foray into multi-media theatre. \r\n\r\nStan Douglas’s films, videos and photographs have been seen in exhibitions internationally, including Documentas IX, X, and XI (1992, 1997, 2002) and three Venice Biennales (1990, 2001, 2005). Solo exhibitions of his work have been have been presented by prominent museums in Europe and North America and a comprehensive survey, \"Past Imperfect: Works 1986–2007,\" was mounted by the Württembergischer Kunstverein and Staatsgalerie, Stuttgart in 2007. In 1986 he organized a touring exhibition of Samuel Beckett’s media works for the Vancouver Art Gallery, \"Samuel Beckett: Teleplays,\" and in 2006 curated \"Beyond Cinema: Art of Projection\" for the Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin. An exhibition of work since 2008 opened at the Carré d’art at Nîmes in 2013 and will tour Europe through 2015. Douglas\'s work is in the collections of major museums, including the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa; Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; Tate Gallery, London; Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; and Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, among others. Douglas is currently Core Faculty in the Graduate Department, Art Center  College of Design, Pasadena, California. He is the recipient of the prestigious Infinity Award, International Center of Photography, New York, in 2012.\r\n\r\nEVENTS & RESOURCES\r\n\r\nThe exhibition is the starting point for DIALOGUES, a

after puzzling Canadian TV viewers with his ‘Television Spots’ (1988), originally conceived as cryptic 15- or 30-second adverts selling absolutely nothing on commercial networks, Stan Douglas has gained a reputation as an enigmatic artist; his films, videos and photographs refining an aesthetic in which meaning is provisional and migratory. It should come as no surprise that he has made a film reworking the idea behind “Rashomon”, Akira Kurosawa’s 1950 masterpiece. In “Klatsassin” (2006) Douglas constructs a coastal rainforest Western, populated by a cast of unreliable narrators whose multiple accounts of a violent incident are as much a philosophical statement as they are episodes in a film narrative.\r\n\r\nDouglas understands history as a string of contingencies. This recognition sets an elegiac tone for much of his work, marked by a fascination with those moments when historical events might have taken a different turn. What if the Cuban Revolution, the colonization of Vancouver Island, the political unrest in Paris in May of 1968, had turned out differently? In posing these questions he constructs lost histories in the guise of newly imagined narratives. These re-imaginings reflect on their own conditional nature, and their way of telling mirrors the tale being told. Douglas’ films and videos have no beginning and no end. As he says, ‘life is all middle’.\r\n\r\nBefore we talked at his Vancouver studio, Douglas showed me his most recent project, “Vidéo” (2006), which conflates two extant film sources: Samuel Beckett’s “Film” (1965) and Orson Welles’ “The Trial” (1962). Hybridizing the style and tone of his sources, he sets his story in contemporary Paris and comes up with a haunting narrative that insinuates a sense of disturbing watchfulness and past and present danger.\r\n -Robert Enright\r\n\r\nROBERT ENRIGHT: How did you come to make “Vidéo” using the two sources you chose?\r\n\r\nSTAN DOUGLAS: Early last year I was teaching in Berlin and being harassed, for odd reasons, by the university administration. One evening I was to meet two curators from the Centre Pompidou in Paris to discuss the possibility of me doing a new work for the Beckett exhibition. I had been thinking about Beckett’s “Film” as a kind of cinematic lipogram, in which we never see a reverse shot of the protagonist until the very end, but I didn’t really know what I would do. As I was getting ready to go to the meeting I noticed a copy of Kafka’s “The Trial” (1925) on a bookshelf in the apartment where I was staying and everything clicked: I remembered seeing Orson Welles’ version of “The Trial”, filmed in the derelict Gare D’Orsay and, what I presumed, were the then-new Paris suburbs, then I remembered that I had been staying in the same apartment while the riots were going on in Parisian banlieues during the fall of 2005. Welles actually shot his exteriors among housing projects in Zagreb but I stuck with my original inclination and used locations on the outskirts of Paris. It turned out that the place I was most interested in, La Courneuve, was the site of the most violent demonstrations in November 2005, and the tower I liked best was the fictional home of the heroine in Jean-Luc Godard’s “Two or Three Things I Know about Her” (1967).\r\n\r\nRE: What’s notable is the way film history is implicated in your making of a film.\r\n\r\nSD: Yes, people often say that it’s impossible to have an original idea because everything has already been thought of, or that every book is the rewriting of a book that has already been written. I try to be honest in the way I work with these source materials and admit freely and immediately what I am elaborating upon. But since these stories are very basic and shared in a certain way, it is the time, manner and matter of the telling that makes one thing unique or different.\r\n\r\nRE: Does it matter whether people are as aware as you are of the sources and references in the film? Does the viewer need to bring the same knowledge to the seeing that you bring to the making?\r\n\r\nSD: It is, and it isn’t necessary for the viewer to be as aware. At a certain point, if you can’t parse the work just by experiencing it and having everyday knowledge of television and film – if it doesn’t work from the level of a person coming at it cold, then it really isn’t successful. If you have to have an exterior text to explain what the work is, then the work isn’t complete in itself. Somebody who does know these historical references can have a more complex understanding of what’s going on, but it’s absolutely not necessary.\r\n\r\nRE: Can you ever look at a film innocently?\r\n\r\nSD: Of course, but no filmmaker is truly innocent. They’ve looked at other films in order to make their own, so they’re never pure to begin with. And being aware of other approaches helps any filmmaker break their habits, especially when they discover their own habits in the work of someone else.\r\n\r\nRE: Is your looking invariably a kind of research?\r\n\r\nSD: I can go to a film just for fun or distraction. But I do have a memory. I never imagined when I watched “The Trial” that I would make a film either based on it or that refers to it. But it was somewhere in the back of my mind so that I was able to make the connection when I needed it. This is how intuition works. An artist’s experience becomes a tool kit, an inventory of techniques, that can be put together in a quick fashion.\r\n\r\nRE: You may start with intuition, but you are quite serious about inquiring into every aspect of what making the film might entail.\r\n\r\nSD: Yes, but a lot of the research turns out to be of no use. I do research to a point where I know enough about a situation that I don’t have to think about it anymore. That’s what the research is for; it’s not to illustrate something you’ve researched directly, but to have an understanding of the flavour of a situation or a moment in time. This is the difference between what Marcel Proust called ‘voluntary’ and ‘involuntary’ memory.\r\n\r\nRE: Is it an inevitable development that your work gets more complicated? If I think of what happens in “Overture” (1986) and compare it to “Inconsolable Memories” (2005) or “Klatsassin”, I realize how much more layered these later projects are becoming.\r\n\r\nSD: They’re certainly more complicated than “Overture”, which was just a matter of taking the Edison Company’s pre-existing film and Proust’s pre-existing novel, chopping them up, duplicating them and then putting them together in a certain order. Now I’m writing the words and making the pictures myself, with the help of a 30- or 40-person crew. Those two pieces are certainly less complicated than a studio film, but I got a taste the kind of work that any independent filmmaker has to do in order to make a feature.\r\n\r\nRE: Do you think of yourself as an independent filmmaker?\r\n\r\nSD: Because I’m self-trained, I’m still a little uncomfortable when I’m around a real filmmaker. Nevertheless something I really enjoy these days is working with actors and learning to work with their skills in maintaining a character over a period of time. A lot of what I asked actors to do before was quite technical but the recent projects have allowed me to develop dramatic situations. It took me a long time to figure out what a director’s responsibility was, but I was able to deduce it from what the cast and crew expected of me. You don’t go too far into the minutiae of your collaborators’ respective crafts, or you will just piss them off, but you have to be either extremely precise or confidently vague about what you want in order to avoid some nasty surprises. Editing is extremely important also, it’s something I like too because it is, in effect, the time when you make the final draft of your script, if there is one.\r\n\r\nRE: You spent the good portion of a year researching and working on a Beckett project, so he’s obviously been a seminal figure for you.\r\n\r\nSD: I was interested in theatre when I was in high school, and particularly in “Waiting for Godot” (1952). I guess teenage angst played a certain role, but then I forgot about Beckett when I went to art school. Towards the end of my studies I found a copy of “Company” (1979) and I realized Beckett was still alive and writing. I thought he wrote “Waiting for Godot” and “Endgame” (1957), then gave up. I was so impressed that I started reading Beckett in reverse order and discovered that his later books were much more successful than the canonical ones.\r\n\r\nRE: So he re-seduced you back into his world?\r\n\r\nSD: Exactly. For example, “Not I” (1972) became my favourite work of art: a voice talks about herself coming into being through language. Language is something she doesn’t really trust, but it is the only thing she has to make herself exist. That’s the fascinating tautology of the work: the writing is suspicious of itself, but it’s the only thing it has to realize itself. The thing I owe to Beckett is an understanding of the impossibility of communication as something a priori but not absolute. The received wisdom is that his work circles around an endgame and collapses into pure interiority, but I think it stages a condition of doubt and suspicion from which communication can begin.\r\n\r\nRE: You seem invariably to start from the interstitial, from the in-between.\r\n\r\nSD: Yes. Working in the form of loops with these recombinant pieces you can’t really talk about beginnings or ends, which are arbitrary and often produced by the ideological or formal requirements of a narrative form. I mean, life is all middle.\r\n\r\nRE: You’re articulating a lack of certainty inside a frame that has a certain degree of certainty about it. Isn’t that an inherent contradiction?\r\n\r\nSD: Sometimes the certainty is false. To instill confidence in the people you’re working with as a director you have to pretend to know what you’re doing, even if you don’t. Sometimes you have to make leaps that allow the process to continue. You also have to allow a space for improvisation. So it’s a matter of creating a space that’s flexible enough that things can go wrong, where you can let other people contribute ideas to make the project more than you expected. If it’s not different and more than you had planned originally, it’s probably not worth doing. It should have probably remained a script. What I end up with is never what I expected and always different from what I intended. When I was developing “Klatsassin”, I was inspired to revisit “Rashomon” after walking through Stanley Park one day and seeing dappled light coming in through the trees. Kurosawa shot the trial scenes in direct sunlight and the contradictory versions of the murder under the cover of trees with only specks of light punctuating the scene. We planned to shoot our murder scenes in a similar way but the weather didn’t cooperate, it was cloudy. This meant that the visual metaphor would change. It was not what I had imagined, but it still works.\r\n\r\nRE: There is an interesting sense of layering in “Klatsassin”; you go to Kurosawa and you end up with a Western set in British Columbia. How did that work?\r\n\r\nSD: Kurosawa was criticized for being too Western. He often took Western narratives and applied them to his films, or people in the West would make Westerns from his Samurai stories.\r\n\r\nRE: There’s a murder that happens outside 11th-century Kyoto in Kurosawa’s film, and there’s a murder in “Klatsassin” as well. How much play do you allow yourself with the narrative you inherit from Kurosawa?\r\n\r\nSD: There was a lot of play. In “Rashomon” you have a bandit, a ronin and his wife; in “Klatsassin” a thief, a deputy and his prisoner. In both cases there is a scene with rain, from which the strangers who meet are seeking shelter, but the ruin of a city gate is very different from a relatively new roadhouse. In “Rashomon” the characters have arrived by chance, in “Klatsassin” they are where they are because of their different reactions to a gold rush.\r\n\r\nRE: It’s a pretty fantastic-looking cast of characters evident in the related photographic portraits you made. They seem more filmic.\r\n\r\nSD: They all have great faces, faces with peculiar kinds of experience, but they were all types. In that historical situation you would meet people and not care to know them well, but you would care about their function. Are they useful to you or will they be a problem? What is their function up here and how will it affect me? I never gave them names: they all go by their profession or function.\r\n\r\nRE: Do you always develop photographic work out of a film, either prior or afterwards? Has that become a necessary part of your practice?\r\n\r\nSD: It’s not necessary, but it’s a parallel thing. It’s often a way of understanding where I am and what I’m looking at. For the recent ‘Western’ series (2006), I followed the Gold Rush Trail up the Fraser Valley to Barkerville in order to understand the landscape. Obviously it’s not the same as it was in the 19th century, but I could at least start to imagine the situations miners were walking through. I visited a spooky ghost town at a place called Quesnelle Forks that I didn’t expect to find. But I must say that my ‘destination’ was a bit of a disappointment, when I discovered that Barkerville had been made into a theme park, with actors walking around in 19th-century clothing, speaking with English accents and doing street theatre.\r\n\r\nRE: It’s interesting that very few people appear in the photographs you made in Cuba in 2004–5. There is evidence of human activity, just not much human presence.\r\n\r\nSD: I consider those photographs to be less about absence than the stage of an action. As soon as you put in a person, it becomes theatre. We try to understand what they are doing there, what they are thinking, instead of viewing it as an architectural space or an environment with some kind of social potential.\r\n\r\nRE: You say you want to avoid theatre, but there’s a lot of theatricality in the film work you’ve been doing.\r\n\r\nSD: It’s very easy for me to do moving pictures of people, but still images I find very difficult because in a moving picture the person exceeds your expectations in some way. They’re always moving, they’re always fleeting; you can’t hold them and say ‘this is what they are, this is what they represent’. When they’re static, it imposes a certainty on their condition with which I have trouble.\r\n\r\nRE: The Cuban photographs for “Inconsolable Memories” (2005) seem to function differently from the ‘Nootka Sound’ photographs (1996), where you’re doing more traditional landscapes.\r\n\r\nSD: The ‘Nootka Sound’ pictures cover an area which to the untrained eye seems like a natural situation. But if you look at it carefully, you realize it’s been logged at least twice. Plus I was looking at different traces of human presence there: either swamps created by the run-off from logging, a fish trap that is 3,000 years old and still in use, a well that was built by the Spanish when they were there in the 18th century or the replica of a longhouse inside a Catholic church that was a gift from the Spanish state, perversely commemorating their conquest of the area.\r\n\r\nRE: So your engagement with a place is always implicated in its political uses?\r\n\r\nSD: In this work I was conscious of doing an anti-Group of Seven piece [A group of Canadian landscape painters from the 1920s]. Instead of being a landscape ready for exploitation because it is supposedly empty, I wanted to show a landscape that was full of people, that was full of human presence, native as well as European.\r\n\r\nRE: So in that sense it’s the same as what you call your ‘re-purposed’ places in Cuba. There is a history of political and economic use in both those places.\r\n\r\nSD: For me it was like a microcosm of the revolution itself. You re-purpose a state or a country when you have a revolution, but you still see what it was prior to that. You can’t completely revolutionize a country. In a way it’s an analogue of what was going on in a larger scale in Cuba.\r\n\r\nRE: You can’t tell from the Cuban photographs whether this is a place that is being rehabilitated or an image that traces the destruction of that place.\r\n\r\nSD: That’s exactly what it’s like. Is this going forward, is it going backward, is it in stasis? A lot of the locations in Cuba are like that.\r\n\r\nRE: Is looking for places like that your reckoning with the failure of Modernism? I guess what I’m thinking is that all places carry a similar sense of failure. The Modernist project wasn’t the only one to put forward that notion, but don’t all Utopias fail? By its very definition, Utopia is ‘no place’.\r\n\r\nSD: Or they don’t last forever. Maybe there was Utopia in Cuba for a little while and it’s not there any more. Maybe it’s working towards a future that it can never realize but that desire is the Utopia. Literacy in Cuba is higher than in the US even now, and there were probably moments in the 1960s when the revolution was functioning very well, in spite of the fact that the US was actively attempting to depose Fidel Castro. Maybe it’s just me, but there had always been something mythical about Cuba. I went to Cuba because I was curious. I’d met a lot of Cuban artists, and I wanted to see what their home was like before it changed, because it will be a very different place once gerontocracy is over.\r\n\r\nRE: So much of your work has been concerned with finding a notion of social justice and freedom inside society. Where did that come from, and why has it seemed so persistent a search in your work?\r\n\r\nSD: It would seem self-evident that these things are important. The social utility of art is that it provides a language to talk about something that is very complicated in a very condensed manner, or to experience something that you thought was familiar in a new way. In my work I am addressing things I don’t initially understand. I try to make a model of transient or mutable conditions in order to understand them. Hopefully, it will have the same use for other people.\r\n\r\nRE: People remark on the complications of your looping. You have a piece that the viewer has to look at for three days before they see all the permutations. Why not make a simpler version of that narrative?\r\n\r\nSD: It’s not a matter of seeing every possible combination, because it really doesn’t change that much after a certain point. Once you’ve seen all the elements, it’s there in your head as a possible construct. It’s just that I’m not forcing a certain narrative sequence that determines its being understood in a particular way – I’m allowing associative possibilities for an audience, depending on when they arrive and when they decide to leave the work. These aren’t linear works, there is no beginning or end, and there’s absolutely no reason to see all the permutations.\r\n\r\nRE: “I’m not Gary” from the ‘Monodramas’ (1991) is a very focused example of how we can thoroughly misunderstand the notion of race: maybe in a benign way, maybe in not so benign a way. How much has your being black played into your work? The question of the Other and its relation to mainstream culture seems so central to much of what you do.\r\n\r\nSD: I grew up black in Vancouver, which in my youth was a mostly white culture with a large Asian and South Asian component, but not so many people of African or Caribbean descent. So I felt quite isolated and was always in that condition of being the Other. There is an outsider figure in all of my works, who is, I suppose, a surrogate for myself. If you want to psychologize – which I don’t. In any event, the situation in “I’m not Gary” actually happened to me. I was walking down the street and some guy said, ‘Hi, Gary, how are you doing’, and he seemed so certain I was Gary that for a second I doubted myself.\r\n\r\nRE: You have resisted the autobiographical as a way of reading your work, haven’t you?\r\n\r\nSD: Yes. Even though I began this interview with a personal anecdote. I just don’t think that works of art should be treated as symptoms of an artist’s biography. It’s bad enough to say that a work of art is a riddle to be solved, what’s worse is to say that the artist’s personality is the key. The suggestion that a work of art is an effect of personality is highly reductive and shuts down interpretation unless, as in the case of Warhol but very few others, persona is your medium. We know very little about Shakespeare, but Shakespeare is still interesting to us.\r\n\r\nRE: Has film been the thing that has interested you the most? Why did you choose that medium as the principal focus of your practice?\r\n\r\nSD: Is that true? I guess it was always ‘film’ in quotation marks. It didn’t begin there; I began with video, and even then I wasn’t a real video artist, I made ‘video’ so I could work with television — and those videos were all shot on 16 mm film. I have used different idioms of representation – silent film, news broadcasting, musical entertainment, television programmes – working within the language and vocabulary of a pre-existing medium.\r\n\r\nRE: The ‘Television Spots’ and the ‘Monodramas’ are absolutely perplexing for a television viewer. They don’t follow through on the delivery of our conditioned expectations for the medium or the message.\r\n\r\nSD: I suspect they’re obsolete by now because we’re used to teaser ads which seem to have no apparent point. When I was first invited to do “Hors-champs” (1992) at the Centre Pompidou, I think I was invited to make French Television spots. But when I finally saw French television, I realized they wouldn’t work at all because the look of their TV was already heterogeneous. The strict genre rules of advertising and broadcasting that we knew in North America didn’t really exist there, and I had to look at something else.\r\n\r\nRE: The two-sided screen in “Hors-champs” allows you to see what’s happening off-screen. Where did the idea come from for structuring the piece in that way?\r\n\r\nSD: Good question. It had to do with the Hors-champs – the out-of-field, the thing you cannot see. I didn’t know what would happen until it was actually made in space. I just thought of un-opposing things being withheld in a certain way. But having one image surrounded by the halo of an absent image was quite powerful.\r\n\r\nRE: Do you ever set yourself a problem in making a work of art?\r\n\r\nSD: The idea of a work of art being a puzzle that has a solution is not very interesting. Why wouldn’t you simply state the problem and the solution? Why go through the process of making the thing? The ambiguities or, to put it positively, the possibilities of an image that does not have a clear-cut answer allow me to be productive in different and unexpected ways. The thing I always wait for is to be told something about a work of art that I didn’t anticipate.\r\n\r\nRE: A filmmaker like Peter Greenaway sets a problem in his films, or uses a puzzle as a point of departure. Then the film is an elaborate way of inquiring into that puzzle, as if there were a solution to it.\r\n\r\nSD: In Greenaway it’s sort of a mannerist Structuralism, where you’re taking these systematic notions and applying them to a narrative form. In my work the systems are there, but they’re not as important. The recombinant ones are typically for maximum distribution of the narrative elements so that they don’t repeat the same sequences too often. In “Win, Place or Show” (1998) I adopted a technique from Serialist composition and from Arnold Schoenberg, where you don’t repeat any note until you’ve played all the notes in the tone row.\r\n\r\nRE: How important are music and sound in what you’re doing?\r\n\r\nSD: Sound has become more and more important. Early on I would run out of money before I got to the sound mix, but now it plays a crucial role. “Suspiria” (2003) is intimately involved with being there while the music was being recorded, and then breaking it down to be reassembled by the computer system.\r\n\r\nRE: The music in “Hors-champs” also carries heavy political associations, in that it’s connected to May 1968, a period when France had no government for three days. This is one of those times when a revolution almost happened, when things could have turned out differently.\r\n\r\nSD: This was in the early 1990s, when Wynton Marsalis was saying that Free Jazz was a mistake, an experiment of youth. In a way the revivalists were saying this period of experimentation didn’t happen, and that they should legitimate jazz by making a new museum of its tradition. When I was in Paris doing research, I met various expatriate American musicians who felt betrayed. They had been intimately involved in the culture, and their music was an emblem for a revolutionary idea. Then, as the people who were involved in 1968 became part of the status quo, they either associated the music with a mistake, or they were reminded of revolutionary ideas they had abandoned. So on the one hand the music was being ignored in a general sense, and on the other it was being ignored in France for a very specific reason.\r\n\r\nRE: We’ve discussed the influence of Beckett, but someone else who seems to have informed your work is Bertolt Brecht. Brecht allows us to engage a work of art by being conscious of what are our choices as viewers. Your work also invites that.\r\n\r\nSD: Sure, although the alienation effect has a pretension to objectivity that I don’t really agree with. Probably more important for me were the writings on music by Theodor W. Adorno, the idea that in music, which we assume to be either the most expressionistic or formal of media, could be found very discrete social residue or indices. And in the very musical structure of the sonata or the symphonic form he could discover social content. What I found interesting were his close readings of Richard Wagner and Ludwig van Beethoven. His critique of jazz is notoriously dubious, probably because he never really heard it, but his sociology of European music is amazing. I came across his work the year after art school. Typically in art school there was an antagonism towards reading in general, so as an antidote I decided to take on some long books, including “Under the Volcano” (1947) by Malcolm Lowry, “The Making of Americans” (1925) by Gertrude Stein, and “Doctor Faustus” (1947) by Thomas Mann, for which Adorno was the musical adviser. I said, ‘Who’s this Adorno guy?’ and that led me to “The Dialectic of Enlightenment” (1944), “In Search of Wagner” (1938/52) and “The Philosophy of Modern Music” (1949).\r\n\r\nRE: Did you read theory because it was useful?\r\n\r\nSD It just helped me understand things. As I said before, the function of art is to help me make a model of how the world works, or an aspect of how the world works, in order to understand it better. That’s what a theory is. In the social sciences, or in physics, theory is a proposition, ‘Maybe the world is like this,’ and then pursuing your research according to that idea. In my work I’ve said maybe globalization feels like “Journey into Fear” (2001).\r\n\r\nRE: You also seem to be attracted to stories that have been told filmically at least twice before. It seems like doubleness appears a lot in the work.\r\n\r\nSD: It’s a bad habit, which I hope I have kicked by now. It was something that occurred a lot early on in my work, things always had this binary structure; in “Hors-champs”, in “Der Sandman” (1995), in “Nu’tka” (1996) in “Win, Place or Show” and in “Journey Into Fear”.\r\n\r\nRE: Did you feel it was a structural limitation in the way you were using it?\r\n\r\nSD: I just felt it was becoming a bad habit. It began because two is the smallest unit with which you can have conflict. But lately I have shied away from the double screens that I was using.\r\n\r\nRE: Does one piece of yours naturally lead you to the next? Is there that kind of causality in the practice? I guess what I’m asking you about is musing, about the source of inspiration.\r\n\r\nSD: I try to start from scratch with each new project, but obviously by now I have a tool kit of techniques I use and ways of working with actors and language and the camera that appear again and again. I try to make them as different as possible from each other.\r\n\r\nRE: But it seems that story is often a point of departure for you…\r\n\r\nSD: I’ll have to think about that. The stories tend to come from a place rather than from a story itself. It’s not like ‘I have a story, so let’s find a place where I can make that story’; it’s more like, ‘Here is this place – what is its story?’\r\n\r\nRE: I’m struck every time I come to Vancouver at how distinctive and pervasive a place it is.\r\n\r\nSD: I’ve noticed that people who are born here don’t like to leave. I tend to make works that alternate between something very local and something that is away, so it’s away and at home, away and at home. “Klatsassin” was the home story, but then “Vidéo” was shot in Paris. But Vancouver has been important to me, absolutely.\r\n\r\nRE: What about your role inside what is recognized within the art world as the Vancouver School?\r\n\r\nSD: I wasn’t a really a part of it. Ian Wallace, Jeff Wall, Rodney Graham and Ken Lum were a group of artists who’d met every week at the bar. They’d do projects and exhibit together; they’d discuss and write about each other’s work. They developed a very productive relationship. Even though you had the Western Front being part of the Fluxus network, Ian and Ingrid Baxter as N.E. Thing Company establishing international connections within the museum world, it was those four artists who made Vancouver a go-to place for curators and critics. But it’s easier for critics to talk about the Vancouver School brand than it is to talk about the more complex conditions that really exist here. They really can’t get over the fact that so many good artists have developed in this tiny out-of-the-way place on the edge of North America called Vancouver. The really disappointing thing in this city is the general indifference to its own history and culture. Beautiful buildings get torn down all the time and are replaced by monstrosities that aren’t built to last. This neighbourhood is so unhinged because drug dealers and users have been given no-go zones elsewhere in the city. The neighbourhood has been left to go fallow, but that will change because there is only so much real estate here, with mountains on one side and the ocean on the other.\r\n\r\nRE: Are you optimistic about this area? You’ve built your studio here.\r\n\r\nSD: Yes. I always had studios in this neighbourhood, from a time when my milieu was not so much just artists as it was artists and poets. The formal and informal discussions instigated by the first incarnation of a writers’ collective here called the Kootenay School of Writing, was a fundamental influence on my practice. The level of conversation at art school wasn’t all that satisfying but the series of artist/writers talks sponsored by KSW were great, if only because there was something one didn’t understand about the other’s medium and you had to explain things that you otherwise took for granted.\r\n\r\nRE: Are you surprised by the success you’ve had?\r\n\r\nSD: Right place at the right time.\r\n\r\nFRIEZE,

Minor White began his career in Oregon between 1937 and 1942 and his employment with the Works Progress Administration (WPA). The WPA was the largest agency and public works project of the New Deal—a federally funded response to the Great Depression. While mainly self-taught, White was hired as a photographer for the Federal Art Project in Oregon—a program created to preserve and document the “unique and often vanishing features of each state.” \r\n\r\nWhen Minor White arrives in Portland in 1937 from Minneapolis, he lives at the YMCA and has a job as a night clerk at the Beverly Hotel. He joins the Oregon Camera Club, a group with traditional views on photography, mainly to access their facilities and learn the technicalities of the medium. In 1939, he is selected by the WPA to document more than two hundred of Portland’s cast iron buildings in an effort to preserve an urbanism that was fast disappearing at the hand of the many modernization projects that were occurring in the city at the time. \r\n\r\nMany of the cast iron buildings that White was assigned to photograph were on Front Street and slated for demolition in order to widen the street, which exists today as SW Naito Parkway. In 1939, White photographs the Hallock & McMillan building (1857), then the second oldest brick building, and now Portland’s oldest commercial structure predating Oregon’s statehood in 1859. In addition to architectural subjects, the majority of the photographs that White submitted to the WPA were of activities along the Willamette River and Portland’s working waterfront—bridges, cranes, docks and piers; railroad yards, lumber mills and grain elevators; ships docked and boats towing log booms abut the growing city, side by side. \r\n\r\nIn 1940, the WPA assigned White to La Grande, Oregon, a remote country town with population 8,000, located near the Idaho border and surrounded by wheat fields and wilderness. In La Grande, White taught photography at the Art Center, documented art classes and cultural events, and wrote art criticism. White produced most of his independent work in eastern Oregon, focusing on the landscape and its wilderness—country where no one had set foot. For Minor White, it was here that he first came to see photography as much an artistic as a social medium. \r\n\r\nThese photographic explorations led to White’s first solo show at the Portland Art Museum in 1941 where 72 of his eastern Oregon photographs were shown. Though White received his draft letter a month after the exhibition opened, his Oregon photographs brought him national attention and four of the photographs from the Portland Art Museum were shown at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in 1942. \r\n\r\nWhite continued to return to Oregon where he taught many classes and workshops, and photographed over the next decades. White is quoted as saying that his time in Oregon is when he discovered everything he wanted to do with photography; the rest of his career was spent refining and exploring those discoveries. \r\n\r\nIn 2014, The J. P. Getty Museum recognized the significance of Minor White’s contribution to photography with a major survey show and catalogue of his work, “Manifestations of the Spirit.” The last time Minor White was shown in Portland was in 1989 in “Minor White: The Eye That Shapes” organized by Princeton University Art Museum which traveled to the Portland Art Museum. More than twenty-five years have now passed since Minor White’s work has been celebrated in Portland. \r\n\r\nZena’s “Minor White: 1857 Project” brings into public view Minor White’s early works in Oregon, most of which have never been seen, and some, not since 1941. \r\n\r\n',NULL),(90,1,'2014-11-16 14:04:50','2020-11-24 01:31:59',NULL,'Images',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'images',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Images',_binary 'All images copyright Laura Heit\r\n\r\nInstallation photos by Mario Gallucci\r\n\r\nPhotographs courtesy of the Oregon Historical Society\'s Davies Family Research Library',NULL),(94,1,'2014-11-26 09:07:57','2020-11-24 01:31:59',3,'Conversationâ€”hausderkunst',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'conversationa-hausderkunst',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Conversation—hausderkunst',_binary '<iframe width=\"854\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1MgKL_G0yPA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>',NULL),(128,1,'2015-05-19 22:10:51','2020-11-24 01:31:59',5,'Tickets',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'tickets',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Tickets',_binary 'FREE ADMISSION FOR ZENA MEMBERS  \r\nFor year-round free admission to events and priority seating, \r\nsee SUPPORT \r\n<form target=\"paypal\" action=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr\" method=\"post\">\r\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"cmd\" value=\"_s-xclick\">\r\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"hosted_button_id\" value=\"RY4WBALAZH6J8\">\r\n<table>\r\n<tr><td><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"on0\" value=\"Dialogues: Event Tickets\">Dialogues: Event Tickets</td></tr><tr><td><select name=\"os0\">\r\n	<option value=\"Event 1: General\">Event 1, September 17: General $5.00 USD</option>\r\n	<option value=\"Event 1: Student, artist, senior\">Event 1: Student, artist, senior $3.00 USD</option>\r\n	<option value=\"Event 2, September 24: General\">Event 2: General $5.00 USD</option>\r\n	<option value=\"Event 2: Student, artist, senior\">Event 2: Student, artist, senior $3.00 USD</option>\r\n</select> </td></tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"currency_code\" value=\"USD\">\r\n<input type=\"image\" src=\"https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_cart_LG.gif\" border=\"0\" name=\"submit\" alt=\"PayPal - The safer, easier way to pay online!\">\r\n<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/scr/pixel.gif\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">\r\n</form>\r\n',NULL),(219,1,'2017-08-30 10:54:05','2020-11-24 01:31:59',2,'Events',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'events',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Events','',NULL),(220,1,'2017-08-30 10:54:30','2020-11-24 01:31:59',3,'Reading',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'reading',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Reading','',NULL),(221,1,'2017-08-30 10:55:11','2020-11-24 01:31:59',4,'Images',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'images',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Images','',NULL),(95,1,'2015-01-14 17:39:03','2020-11-24 01:31:59',NULL,'Untitled',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'untitled',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','',NULL),(96,1,'2015-01-14 17:39:37','2020-11-24 01:31:59',NULL,'Reference works',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'reference-works',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',_binary 'Reference works',NULL),(97,1,'2015-01-24 08:00:42','2020-11-24 01:31:59',NULL,'Dialogues',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'dialogues',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Dialogues',_binary 'DIALOGUES\r\nAnthony McCall: Artist Project Season at the historic 1857 \r\n\r\nDialogues is Zena Zezza’s series of performative conversations on the ideas and influences within Anthony McCall\'s work, bringing together theory, scholarship and artists\' practices in the space of the exhibition. \r\n\r\nSaturday, February 7, 3–5pm\r\nPICTURE YOURSELF, A MOTE \r\nKris Cohen and Abigail Susik \r\n\r\nKris Cohen is Assistant Professor of Art and Humanities at Reed College and Abigail Susik is Assistant Professor of Art History at Willamette University.\r\n\r\nSaturday, February 21, 12–4pm (two-part event)\r\nARGUMENT: ANTHONY MCCALL AND ANDREW TYNDALL\'S 1978 FILM AND DISCURSIVE EVENT\r\nThomas Beard\r\n\r\nThomas Beard is Co-director of Light Industry in Brooklyn.\r\n\r\nTHE ARTIST, THE ART OF FILM AND THE INSTITUTION\r\nRudolf Frieling \r\n\r\nRudolf Frieling is Curator of Media Arts at San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.\r\n\r\nSaturday, February 28, 7pm\r\nIN THE SPIRIT OF JEAN DUPUY\'S 1974 \"SOUP AND TART”\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of Jean Dupuy\'s 1974 event at The Kitchen in which Anthony McCall participated, over 30 artists from Portland and beyond present two-minute performances.

Two recent publications offer the greatest vantage yet for understanding the breadth of his art and ideas: \"Anthony McCall: 1970s Works on Paper\" (Walther König, 2014) an authoritative account of McCall’s first decade of work, and the forthcoming \"Anthony McCall: Notebooks and Conversations\" (Lund Humphries, 2015) which collects 10 years of interviews between the artist, Graham Ellard, and Stephen Johnstone. McCall is a recipient of a Berlin Prize Fellowship Fall 2014, and his retrospective \"Anthony McCall: Solid Light Films and Other Works\" is currently open at the EYE Film Museum in Amsterdam (September 28 – November 30, 2014). McCall met with Jarrett Earnest in his TriBeCa studio to discuss his origins in performance art, drawing in space, and turning off the lights on moving trains.\r\n<br><br>\r\nJARRETT EARNEST (Rail): There is an interesting shift in the titling of the solid light pieces, from matter-of-fact names like “Line Describing a Cone” (1973) to the recent “Between You and I” (2006) and “Coupling” (2009). These new emotionally charged titles seemed so different from the intentions of the ’70s film titles. What led to approaching the solid light in this way?\r\n<br><br>\r\nANTHONY MCCALL: There’s nearly 30 years between the early films and the recent ones. That’s quite a gap—I have early work and late work and nothing in between. One of the reasons I didn’t go back any earlier is that I had a visibility problem that I couldn’t solve. Without the dust of old loft buildings or the smoke of cigarettes, my early solid-light works were virtually invisible—invisible, that is, until the ’90s, when the haze machine was invented. That’s when I began to look at the early films again. One of these, \"Cone of Variable Volume\" (1974), repeatedly expands and contracts—grows larger and smaller. When I looked at this film in the late ’90s I was surprised that there was something there that I hadn’t noticed when I made it, which was that this 30-foot-long cone of light, floating there in mid-air, in the dark, was quite unmistakably breathing—in and out, in and out. This observation actually gave me a new entry point. I was able to retain all the original ideas of solid light—for instance the re-orientation of the spectator toward the volumetric form in space and away from image projected on the wall—to take all that as a given but with the added idea of representing the corporeal. \r\n<br><br>\r\nJE: I want to ask you about solid light as a sculptural experience. When I was looking at Roni Horn’s tubs of clear glass I was thinking about the experience of encountering those objects with my body—they are translucent, have a visual continuity between the interior and exterior, and are extremely dense. There’s a related but almost opposite experience with solid light: you are presented with a translucent object that you perceive as existing, but it is immaterial. I want to understand the nature of solid light as a physical experience, as a sculptural problem rather than as a visual phenomenon. \r\n<br><br>\r\nAMc: Perhaps the first thing to say about solid light is that it can only be seen in the dark. That is very obvious, but this alone separates it from most sculpture; and psychologically a dark space is highly charged because of our vulnerability within it—the extent of the space and what may lie within it and beyond is unknown. Anything may be lurking in there. Then there is the paradox of solid light: the membranes of light are so palpable that spectators often test them by reaching out to touch them, even though there is only thin air. And yet, the planes of light are not an illusion: they are actually, I might say physically, present in three-dimensional space. \r\n<br><br>\r\nJE: With the vertical projections there are spaces carved out that create a relation between inside and outside. How does the body experience those volumes?\r\n<br><br>\r\nAMc: For the vertical pieces the projector is up on the ceiling, 30 feet up, projecting down onto the floor. You see the projected lines on the floor at the same time that you are facing sheer walls of light that rise far above your head. This produces a roughly conical, tent-like form towering above you with a clear inside and outside. Invariably these forms have apertures, which may suggest entrances, and walls of light that often define separate internal chambers. So the references are architectural as well as sculptural, and looking involves walking into the chambers, standing within them, looking steeply upwards at the volumetric space, and looking down at the lines on the floor that define the base of the form. With most large-scale sculpture, we construct our understanding of the object by shifting around it, and sometimes by going in and out of it. This is certainly true of my solid light objects, but there is an added element: the walls and chambers that define the sculptural object are themselves shifting and changing. The speed of change is very slow, which preserves the sense that this is a sculptural object rather than a piece of cinema.\r\n<br><br>\r\nJE: What’s really great about the \"1970s Works on Paper\" book is that it shows how the earliest works from ’72 and ’73 are so clearly involved with performance and conceptual art. “Water Table” (1972) and “Road Work” (1973), for example, look so much like conceptual photography of the time; or films like \"Earth Work\" (1972) that are performances. I like seeing those trajectories flowing into solid light because it shows you something different about it. \r\n<br><br>\r\nAMc: I became a filmmaker because I felt the need to record these ephemeral events. \"Landscape for Fire\" (1972), made only a year before \"Line Describing a Cone,\" was my first film. When you look at them as records of performances you see that they are not taped performances; the films are quite specifically films. \"Landscape for Fire,\" for instance, or \"Earth Work,\" are in color, and full of separate shots tightly edited together. The time is highly compressed—quite unlike video from the same period, which tended to be based on continuous takes in black and white. \r\n<br><br>\r\nJE: I read in one interview you said “performance presupposed the problem of documentation,” which is very prescient because of the way scholars are trying to talk about the history of performance art, and the distance between the live performance and the photograph.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAMc: For me, one of the problems the \"1970s Works on Paper\" book presented, when we were putting it together, was not knowing when something on paper was a work of art or when it was something else, like a document. In the end I decided that it wasn’t for me to decide and I just put it all in. The difficulty I encountered when I started showing the performance films like \"Landscape for Fire\" was that you could never escape the problem that the film was a second-hand record: all that happened, happened in the past. The primary event was still the performance itself. This led me to think about the possibility of a film that was itself a primary event, an event that only occurred at the moment of projection. \"Line Describing a Cone\" was the first piece that came out of this train of thought.\r\n<br><br>\r\nJE: \"Long Film for Ambient Light\" (1975) was an empty loft with covered windows and a single bulb, with a chart along the wall framing a specific interval in time. There was a written statement on the wall called “Notes on Duration.” In that text you say a “piece of paper on the wall is as much duration as the projection of a film. Its only difference is in its immediate relationship to our perception.” How has that engagement with time changed in the new work that enacts looping and long cycles in installations?\r\n<br><br>\r\nAMc: In the ’70s, it seemed important to make that point about paper also being a durational event because durational events—anything explicitly time-based—were actively defined as being outside the realm of serious art. Regarding looping and cycles I’d like to suggest a distinction between the two. In my definition, any composed film or video can be looped, whatever its structure. Essentially, you just keep re-playing it. But a cyclical piece is quite different because its internal structure already pre-figures the ongoing repetition of continuous exhibition; it is often hard to tell where it begins and ends because beginning and ending are incompatible with installation structure.\r\n<br><br>\r\nJE: So, structurally, when you started showing \"Line Describing a Cone\" as an installation in the 2000s, was that a loop or a cycle?\r\n<br><br>\r\nAMc: It was a loop, because \"Line Describing a Cone\" is really a narrative film; it announces its purpose at the beginning and it delivers it: it finishes. When \"Into The Light: The Projected Image in American Art 1964–1977\" (2001) at the Whitney Museum was being planned, Chrissie Iles and I had a number of discussions as to whether it could be shown as a continuous installation—a format that would best suit museum-exhibition time. In the end I decided it was fine; the later films \"Long Film for Four Projectors\" (1974), \"Four Projected Movements\" (1975), and \"Long Film for Ambient Light\" were all made with an explicitly cyclical structure, which I had evolved precisely with an exploratory, individual visitor in mind, rather than an assembled audience. Actually, after the Into the Light exhibition was over, I rather appreciated the fact that I ended up with two completely different ways to show the same film: once-through to an assembled audience, which brings a certain intensity, or as an installation, with individual visitors who come and go and themselves decide how long to stay.\r\n<br><br>\r\nJE: In \"Landscape for Fire\" and the performance works, what was the context or thinking about performance, before it became more specifically an investigation of film?\r\n<br><br>\r\nAMc: Each fire performance led to the next, throwing up new issues that the next one would address. Looking back, the key thing was coming to understand the relationship between how long something lasts and how it is looked at. The fire performances also enabled me to establish a relationship between staggered time sequences and shifting spatial configurations. In the end, these ideas were all transferred over to the solid light works like \"Long Film for Four Projectors.\" \r\n<br><br>\r\nJE: How about works like \"Two Minute Drawing\" (1974)—could you explain the origins of it and its logic?\r\n<br><br>\r\nAMc: I was circling round these ideas about duration. One of the works was called \"Two Laws of Presentation\" (1975). It took the form of miniature record cards. The laws are: “the form of attention is a function of the form of attending,”  and “the form of attending is a function of the duration.” I was constructing a scale of how long a performance might last. Five seconds? Five minutes? Five hours? Five days? Five years? And how, as a result, a spectator might approach it. That became my framework for understanding that the length of something was your first, most important, decision. Everything followed from that. \r\n<br><br>\r\n\"Two Minute Drawing\" was a performance done at the Kitchen in 1974, at Jean Dupuy’s Soup &amp; Tart. Following a picnic dinner on the floor, there were some 38 two-minute artist performances. My drawing, done at the very end of the evening after timing each performance, was a curved line, the curve of which was determined by those figures (there was a wide range: Charlemagne Palestine’s performance lasted only 25 seconds; the longest was Yvonne Rainer’s at six minutes. Gordon Matta-Clark was almost the only one who came in at two minutes exactly).\r\n <br><br>\r\nJE: An interesting concern seems to be the “figure in landscape”—\"Landscape for Fire,\" \"Landscape for White Squares,\" etc. In his famous essay on your work George Baker concludes by citing Crary on J.M.W. Turner—talking about light—but is there something larger there about the landscape and its importance in English art and literature? Do you think your growing up in England was important for the trajectory of your work?\r\n<br><br>\r\nAMc: It’s a fair question but I don’t think I can answer it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nJE: I was prompted to ask because of your \"Found Solid Light Installation\" (1973), which seems to point toward an interest in England as a specific geographic and atmospheric situation.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAMc: That found map shows all the lighthouses around the coast of England, and the direction in which they project their beams. I came across it soon after making \"Line Describing a Cone\" and I recognized it as relevant to what I was thinking about. Of course, I grew up with lighthouses. Every time we went to the sea in the summer, there they were. And mist and fog were simply part of the weather. A few years back I made a proposal for a public piece in Auckland, New Zealand, which relates to these early performances and films. There was an abandoned cylindrical concrete silo on the waterfront; I proposed to make four vertical cuts into its skin, facing the arc of the sun. During the day the silo would become a receiving chamber for a shifting 45-foot-tall shaft of light, made visible by a haze machine. At night, from the top of the silo, a single, slowly rotating beam of light would be projected out across the harbor. The piece would be called \"Light House.\" \r\n<br><br>\r\nJE: Was \"Landscape for White Squares\" (1972) a performance?\r\n<br><br>\r\nAMc: Yes. At the time I was quite interested in the idea that since performances were mostly seen through the lens of a camera, it seemed appropriate to therefore make them, compose them, through the lens of the camera—in effect collapsing the documentation into the making of the work. All those pieces came out of that:\"Water Table,\" \"Road Work,\" etc. \"Landscape for White Squares\" was a series of still photographs; it was also a short film that was shot early on a January morning on a frozen plowed field covered in mist; the white squares gradually emerge from the mist.\r\n<br><br>\r\nJE: Sounds very romantic. The other piece that comes toward the end of the book is \"Four Figures\" (1975) in which you are exploring the figure relationships of men and women clothed and un-clothed from the famous Manet, “Le Déjeuner-sur l’herbe” (1862¬ to 63). \r\n<br><br>\r\nAMc: For that project I had four models. I photographed each of them individually, each in turn adopting the four poses in the painting, once naked, once dressed. Then there followed an elaborate relay of processes using photomontage: printing each of the individual figures, cutting them out, reassembling them exhaustively to produce different group combinations, and re-photographing and printing the results. \r\n<br><br>\r\nJE: One of the reasons \"Four Figures\" is interesting to me now is that it seems to have something to do with the recent solid light films, the way they are about interrelating multiple bodies in systematic permutations. Of course part of the subtext of my wanting to understand your engagement with performance is that you had a long relationship with Carolee Schneemann, starting in 1971. Your art and hers are the kind that are always separated art historically, but I think, in fact, once you start engaging with the deeper explorations of the work they are very sympathetic and revealing of one another. Almost all the work represented in the \"1970s Works on Paper\" was made while you were with Carolee, and I imagine involved in a context that was deeply engaging questions of embodiment and what became performance art as a set of ideas and practices. \r\n<br><br>\r\nAMc: Yes, that seems right, though at the time our personal aesthetic styles seemed to be almost diametrically opposed. Carolee had done \"Site\" (1964) with Robert Morris; of course, my project must have had something to do with that earlier one! At the time I was very taken with Happenings, Fluxus, and Judson, so we talked about these events and performances a lot. I also read whatever I could find on the subject—I was particularly interested in Alan Kaprow, George Brecht, Yvonne Rainer, and John Cage. \r\n<br><br>\r\nJE: I imagine that John Cage and Happenings were where your performance scores come from—your works were conceived of as scores?\r\n<br><br>\r\nAMc: The works were conceived of as performances but the way I developed them was through score-like drawings, and for those I found graph paper essential. It is interesting, when you look at a lot of work by conceptual artists in this period everyone used graph paper—why is that?\r\n <br><br>\r\nJE: Graph paper, index cards, typewriters, and black-and-white photos are the aesthetics of conceptual art. \r\n<br><br>\r\nAMc: For me it was obvious since the fire pieces were based on counting and on spatial grids. Graph paper made plotting the co-ordinates very simple. But the plotting and drawing was a working-out process: I didn’t conceive of the scores as things in themselves until after the performance was realized. Then I would often make a final, formal version that I suppose completed the piece. Theoretically, that final score could also serve as the blueprint for a future realization.\r\n<br><br>\r\nJE: In the times I’ve experienced your installations, they are so clear and crystalline. I think people not having access to them for a generation, and only having recourse to a few photographs and written descriptions—both of which served a strong agenda of structural film—strongly shaped the scholarly understanding of the films which might be very different if there was a broader continual encounter with them as they were installed in the 1970s. \r\n<br><br>\r\nAMc: Perfectly true; avant-garde cinema was a resilient, maverick culture with strong views. It also had different faces and structural film was just one of those. Though both Michael Snow and Paul Sharits had an exhibition at the Bykert Gallery, the work was mostly shown at downtown avant-garde not-for-profits like Millennium Film Workshop and Collective for Living Cinema, and the audience was largely other filmmakers. So the work was not widely seen. The writing about it tended to be quite theoretical or it justified the work on political grounds, but pleasure was a very tricky subject and rarely mentioned. \r\n<br><br>\r\nJE: Talking about pleasure, there were of course screenings in which you and Carolee were a double bill. \r\n<br><br>\r\nAMc: Yes, we did one at the London Filmmaker’s Co-op in the mid-’70s: the first half was Carolee, she did \"Up To\" and \"Including Her Limits,\" which at that point was a super-8 double-screen projection and live performance with her suspended from a rope. I did the four \"Cone\" films after that. It was a good double program. \r\n<br><br>\r\nJE: When I look at things like \"Circulation Figures\" (2011) I see how they relate to her work and what she was doing in the ’60s. \r\n<br><br>\r\nAMc: Certainly, in my use of newspaper strewn on the floor, that’s probably right.\r\n<br><br>\r\nJE: But it’s also concerned with the perception of space and time and the body in the landscape. What I like about some of the early descriptions of \"Line Describing Cone\" is that you talk about how important the relationship of the body in space is to the projection. The body as a thing we reference is pretty vague, what did that mean to you at that time?\r\n<br><br>\r\nAMc: It meant something quite literal: that the projected circle on the wall would be about the scale of the outstretched arms and legs of a Vitruvian Man—at the wall, your fingers could just reach the skin of the cone. And the projection throw—the length of the cone from projector to wall—would be about three times that distance. Early on, the film was visible because of the dust in the air and cigarette smoke, and it was harder to see than it is today with the use of a haze machine. This fact placed a limit on how big the form might be. Over the past 10 years, thanks to the haze machine and to the fact that digital projectors have grown brighter, I have been able to slightly increase the length and the breadth of the cone, but the outstretched body, somewhere inside that cone, is still the reference, and that sets important limits on scale.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWith the ’70s solid light works, there was the two-dimensional line on the wall, and there was the corresponding volumetric form in space: a circle on the wall, producing a cone in space. The forms were so simple that you could turn your back on the drawing and only attend to the volumetric object. Over the past 10 years, though, as the scale has increased I have been able to work with more complex line drawing. This means that for the spectator there is necessarily more back and forth—looking at and comparing the line drawing on the wall and the form in space. For the visitor in one of the horizontal installations, this involves a lot of turning around and turning back, constantly shifting between two dimensions and three. In the recent Face to Face series I have built this difficulty into the installed pieces by utilizing projectors and screens facing in opposite directions. One of these was in my most recent Sean Kelly exhibition in January 2013. When you were inside the volumetric form of one, you could simultaneously read the two-dimensional drawing of the other. In a way this has given the drawing back its central place in the installations.\r\n <br><br>\r\nJE: Do you think it is productive to think of them foremost as drawings? \r\n<br><br>\r\nAMc: No, I don’t think so, because that leaves out the sheer sculptural presence of the planes of light and the three-dimensional volumes they describe. But the drawing is central: after all, it does actually produce the sculptural volumes. And drawing features in the production process from start to finish: from the earliest perspectival renderings, to the two-dimensional storyboards, through the programming algorithms, right up to the actual projected installation, there is a line drawing right there.\r\n<br><br>\r\nJE: Do you consider pieces like \"Landscape for Fire\" drawings—in space or in the landscape?\r\n<br><br>\r\nAMc: If you were watching one of the fire pieces, you would extrapolate straight lines from the joining up of the individual points of fire, much like you do with landing lights on an airport runway. This was the dynamic in many of the fire pieces, with the configurations within the 36-point grid constantly changing as new lines were ignited and previously lit lines allowed to die. But the physicality of the event and location I think overwhelms the sense of these pieces as drawings.\r\n<br><br>\r\nJE: In the forthcoming \"Notebooks and Conversations\" book there is a reference to Warhol’s \"Empire\" (1964). That makes a lot of sense in terms of duration. Thinking of \"Four Figures,\" and of the sensual aspects of solid light, one could draw a connection to another Warhol film, \"Kiss\" (1963)—kissing and sex are always in the present tense, and you have this interface between two people; from there you have a compelling way to look at the recent solid light installations. \r\n<br><br>\r\nAMc: That is a very unexpected comparison! But you are right. Many of the recent solid light works enact a process of exchange between two parties. The works include \"Between You and I;\" \"You and I Horizontal\" (2005); \"Coupling;\" \"Meeting You Halfway\" (2009); \"Throes\" (2011); \"Face to Face\" (2013); and others.\r\n<br><br>\r\nJE: Compared to the precision of the recent works there seems like a great tenderness in the hand-drawnness of the ’70s \"Cone\" films, which were supposed to be the height of austere purity, but looking back they seem very human. \r\n<br><br>\r\nAMc: The digital world has made the analog world look very, very handmade. A good illustration of this would be my 16mm-film \"Line Describing a Cone,\" made in 1973, and the digital remake of the same piece in 2010, which was named \"Line Describing a Cone 2.0.\" The original started with a white gouache line drawing of a half circle, which was filmed under a 16mm-animation camera. \"Line Describing a Cone 2.0\" was made using digital animation techniques. The re-make was an exact rendering of the original idea; in fact, more exact than the 1973 original. The original has all kinds of imperfections, since my animation abilities were rather un-schooled. The first showing of the digital version was at Tate Modern, alongside the original film version. It was very clear how different they were. With the film version, the 16mm-projector produces an image that has a slight shake to it; the edges of the frame are rather woolly, the thickness of the line varies, there is a passage where the two halves of the circle fail to meet, and over the years the original had become worn, producing on the prints a patina of small scratches. The digital re-make was rock-steady, with the edges of the frame being sharp and rectangular, and the thickness of the line and its motion were perfectly constant. So visually they were very different, but their conceptual DNA was identical. In the end what was interesting to me was that as a work of art being looked at by an assembled audience, the two films, despite their visual differences, worked in exactly the same way. But it is beginning to look like the difference between film and digital will continue to increase. For instance, as our eyes adjust to increasingly brighter, sharper, digital projectors and screens, my solid light works on film by comparison will presumably seem dimmer and even more hand-made than they do now.\r\n<br><br>\r\nJE: One interesting discovery in this book was your work \"Darkness\" (1972) which made me think of the piece that Martin Creed received a Turner Prize for in \"Work No. 227\" (2001)—turning the lights on and off. How did you conceive and execute it?\r\n<br><br>\r\nAMc: There was a festival in theU.K. in 1972 called \"ICES: International Carnival of Experimental Sound.\" Cage and Tudor came over and did \"HPSCHD\" (1969)—which was an important performance for me. My \"Landscape for Fire II,\" performed out on the North Weald on a disused World War II airfield, was one of the festival events. Towards the end, the festival booked an entire private train that left Kings Cross early in the morning for Edinburgh where the Edinburgh Festival was in progress. We returned that night. On board the train on the way up there were many performances—Carolee for instance, did a piece on roller-skates—it was a fantastic and international group: artists, composers, musicians, performers, writers, you name it. I was going to do a fire performance when I got up to Edinburgh but when we arrived we met with the fire brigade who said we couldn’t, it being such a spontaneous festival that no one had thought to check. So I improvised a new performance called \"Smoke Without Fire\" (1972) in the basement yard of Ricky DeMarco Gallery. My piece \"Darkness\" happened on the train back. The score read: “At a single point during the journey back to London, after dark, all the lights of the train are switched off for a period of three and a half minutes.” However, on board the train on the way up, I had discovered that there was no master switch to turn off all the lights at once. So I turned them off, and then on again a few minutes later, one carriage at a time. \r\n<br><br>\r\nJE: Do you feel that there have been persistent misunderstandings of any aspects of your work?\r\n<br><br>\r\nAMc: It was more a case of challenging material circumstances. In the ’70s and well beyond, there was simply no way to make a living from the kind of work I was doing. But that in turn was connected to the limits that both criticism and the market placed on what was considered art. The profound shift that has occurred over the last two decades is the absorption by the art world of durational work, whether it be performance, film, sound, video, or installation. In the ’70s I was a part of what was called expanded cinema. In retrospect, expanded cinema looks now to be a mere controlled explosion compared to the big-bang of the digital revolution. It’s not just the art world itself that has changed, it’s that the whole idea of cinema has fragmented, and one of the many new places it has lodged is inside the art world.\r\n<br><br>\r\nJARRETT EARNEST is an artist and scholar currently living in Brooklyn.\r\n</div>',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(117,1,'2015-05-19 21:08:37','2020-11-24 01:31:59',3,'Reading',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'reading',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Reading','',NULL),(110,1,'2015-05-19 20:36:14','2020-11-24 01:31:59',3,'Images',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'images',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Images','',NULL),(111,1,'2015-05-19 20:36:35','2020-11-24 01:31:59',4,'Videos',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'videos',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Videos','',NULL),(112,1,'2015-05-19 20:38:49','2021-05-26 20:37:27',1,'Dialogues',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'dialogues',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Anthony McCall: Artist Project Season at the historic 1857',_binary 'Dialogues is Zena Zezza’s series of performative conversations on the ideas and influences within Anthony McCall\'s work, bringing together theory, scholarship and artists\' practices in the space of the exhibition. \r\n<br><br>\r\nSaturday, February 7, 3–5pm<br>\r\nPICTURE YOURSELF, A MOTE <br>\r\nKris Cohen and Abigail Susik \r\n<br><br>\r\nKris Cohen is Assistant Professor of Art and Humanities at Reed College and Abigail Susik is Assistant Professor of Art History at Willamette University.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSaturday, February 21, 12–4pm (two-part event)<br>\r\nARGUMENT: ANTHONY MCCALL AND ANDREW TYNDALL\'S 1978 FILM AND DISCURSIVE EVENT<br>\r\nThomas Beard\r\n<br><br>\r\nThomas Beard is Co-director of Light Industry in Brooklyn.\r\n<br><br>\r\nTHE ARTIST, THE ART OF FILM AND THE INSTITUTION<br>\r\nRudolf Frieling \r\n<br><br>\r\nRudolf Frieling is Curator of Media Arts at San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSaturday, February 28, 7pm<br>\r\nIN THE SPIRIT OF JEAN DUPUY\'S 1974 \"SOUP AND TART”\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn the spirit of Jean Dupuy\'s 1974 event at The Kitchen in which Anthony McCall participated, over 30 Portland artists present two-minute performances.

McCall famously said that he wanted to transform a cinema audience into a collection of individuals. In this discussion, Cohen and Susik will explore a range of historical sources, contemporary theories and cultural trends that were current at the time of McCall’s quest to realize this ambition. Focal points for the conversation include the modernist legacy of synesthesia, media archaeologies and the aesthetics of technology, as well as the influence of systems theories, cybernetics, networks and their interrelations during the 1960s and ‘70s. Cohen and Susik will also discuss the politics of individuality versus collectivity today, and ask whether McCall\'s recent projection works, employing digital projectors, computer programmers and hazers, address these issues. \r\n<br><br>\r\nDr. Kris Cohen is Assistant Professor of Art and Humanities at Reed College.

Argument has been described by its makers as “a film of intervention.” Partially inspired by Godard and Gorin’s Letter to Jane, it is an essay film built around images of men’s fashion ads from an issue of the New York Times Magazine. Fashion photographs are used as a starting point for a political investigation of news, advertising and images of masculinity—while at the same time, the filmmakers reflect on their own position and the possibility of a radical film practice. The film has been made to engage those very problems that filmmakers confront economically, aesthetically, theoretically and politically.\r\n\r\nThomas Beard is a founder and director of Light Industry, a venue for film and electronic art in Brooklyn, New York. Light Industry explores new models for the presentation of cinema, drawing inspiration from the history of alternative art spaces in New York as well its storied tradition of cinematheques. Beard has curated film programs for, among others, the 2012 Whitney Biennial; Unfinished for the Metropolitan Museum; and Couchsurfing for multiple venues. Beard has presented numerous works of Anthony McCall’s, including the installation of Long Film for Ambient Light.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARTIST, THE ART OF FILM AND THE INSTITUTION\r\nRudolf Frieling\r\n\r\nIn 1976, Anthony McCall declared a radical shift in his artistic direction in an unpublished statement titled “Film as a Connective Catalyst,” delivered before a distinguished audience of critics and filmmakers including Annette Michelson, Hollis Frampton, Tony Conrad and others. From objects and primary structures to films as a \"primary event,\"Anthony McCall was among those artists who rejected the notion of installing art in museum galleries, declaring that contemporary avant-garde filmmakers had succeeded in doing little more than changing venues from the art house to the actual museum. Four decades later, he is among those artists who push museums to review, restage, and reperform primary events as museum pieces. Some claim that this is a mis-representation and revisionist deformation of a historic period, others, myself included, believe that the question of \"what and where the object is\" is a productive question which is needed today to redefine museum practice. When we think of time-based installations as performative events of \"objects\" and rules, we can push the notion of a museum collection as a \"performative event.\"\r\n\r\nRudolf Frieling is Curator of Media Art at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Prior to SFMOMA, Frieling was curator at the ZKM Center for Art and Media in Karlsruhe, Germany from 1994 to 2006.

One instance of that would be your essay in the catalogue to an exhibition of Beckett teleplays, which you curated in 1988. In it you argue that in place of a closed world like Sade\'s, which is invented to be mastered, Beckett \'imagines an uncertain one: the residence of even less certain subjectivity.\' Another would be your proclivity for film loops, as in “Overture”, thus not only making the piece continuous, but divesting it of a climax. There\'s a related avoidance of narrative resolution in the film script for “Pursuit, Fear, Catastrophe: Ruskin, BC”. Do you regard this as a philosophical position or part of your aesthetic?\r\n\r\nSTAN DOUGLAS: Both in terms of presentation and the subject matter of my work, I have been preoccupied with failed utopias and obsolete technologies. To a large degree, my concern is not to redeem these past events but to reconsider them: to understand why these utopian moments did not fulfill themselves, what larger forces kept a local moment a minor moment: and what was valuable there – what might still be useful today. In both the gallery pieces and the TV pieces I\'m looking at supposedly inconsequential moments of life. Yet these are perhaps the most significant ones, because they are the ones where habit is predominant, where people aren\'t strictly attending to how they\'re behaving. So, in the narratives of the TV projects, and also in the more thematically structured gallery works, I\'m trying to reconsider what has been either a habitual discarding of personal habit or a larger cultural one, in as much as cultural forces go through the same process.\r\n\r\nLC: What led you to these media? How did you end up working primarily with reproductive technologies?\r\n\r\nSD: Part of it is the fact that I can\'t draw. But it\'s often also the result of trying to find the appropriate medium for the subject matter of the work. I learned quite a bit about these different media trying to make the projects as different from each other as possible. A certain subject will eventually draw me to a particular medium. Since I\'m interested in the cultural and the psychological effects as well as the social situation of television broadcasting, I have to work with the medium of television itself. The player piano piece, “Onomatopoeia”, is concerned with evoking certain historical moments, and certain notions of absence, which the very formal presentation both embodies and represents at the same time.\r\n\r\nLC: When you say you can\'t draw, is that a consequence of your art school training?\r\n\r\nSD: I did go to art school, where I did a little bit of drafting and technical drawing. But I was just too lazy to learn how to draw. \r\n\r\nLC: Does this reinforce your tendency to write?\r\n\r\nSD: That has evolved with the projects. Developing them by way of notes and textual research, as well as reading a lot, gave me various models of how to write, and eventually I began doing it myself. The essay for the Beckett catalogue was the first essay I had ever written: it was out of necessity.\r\n\r\nLC: How do you find your subject?\r\n\r\nSD: It\'s always quite by accident. With the Ruskin works, for example, I had gone on a boating trip with some friends during which we came upon an extraordinary site: a power station built in 1930, which looks like a vampire\'s château set in the landscape. Next to it there is a very well-tended second-growth forest maintained by a regional hydro company, as well as a somewhat devastated runoff area. What\'s left of the Stave River is flanked on one side by wealthy holiday homes and on the other side by small lumber mills and a couple of trailer courts. The name \'Ruskin\' made me curious about it. I learned that it was originally established as a Ruskinian utopian community, which failed after only two years of operation. Since then it has been the site of various small local communities, none of which lasted very long. Around 1900, business ventures and later, a large Japanese community formed there until the internment during World War II, when they were declared \'enemy aliens\', and their land was expropriated by the government. “Pursuit, Fear, Catastrophe: Ruskin, BC” developed out of finding this location, and being fascinated by it.\r\n\r\nLC: Have those who were interned fought to be recompensed? Is a political issue implicit in the work?\r\n\r\nSD: About five years ago, after years of lobbying, there was a redress in Canada. But monetary recompense for the internment, for that injustice, can only be symbolic. And it\'s very, very difficult to find out who was in that community, because the purpose of internment was to destroy the social fabric of the Japanese-Canadian community. It was a community of ex-guest workers – all of whom were therefore de facto Canadians – who were developing their own social relationships with the country. The purpose of the internment was to break up those communities and to leave them no possibility of having any solid social ground. It\'s only recently that people have been able to reconstruct the whole fabric – their relationships and families. Indirectly, the film-script bears upon this, in that two policemen seem quite happy to discredit the reputation of the Japanese man, and his race as a whole.\r\n\r\nWhen I did the research for this project, I went to the provincial archives and looked at the daily diaries of constables working in this area and of the others working in very isolated areas. Part of their job in the 1930s was to keep the different racial groups separate, preventing any kind of coalition that might cause a social or economic threat to the status quo. Everybody was catalogued by race. The Japanese, Chinese, \'Hindoos\' – spelled with two o\'s – Jews, and Italians etc., were all categorized as other to the Anglo-Saxon majority. This is presented in the film in what seems a nonchalant, matter of fact manner. That was how they went about the business of containing these different racial groups.\r\n\r\nLC: It\'s automatic: routine rather than considered behaviour.\r\n\r\nSD: Exactly.\r\n\r\nLC: In “Pursuit, Fear, Catastrophe...” you are dealing with the material in two different forms. There is the group of colour photographs with two text panels, which has already been exhibited, and then there\'s the film that you\'re currently making. How do the two compare? On a previous occasion you also developed the same body of material into quite different idioms, didn\'t you?\r\n\r\nSD: Yes. Those location photographs are part of my process of going out and considering the site. In assembling them into a work for exhibition I was trying to make slightly decrepit sites around Ruskin look like nineteenth-century English landscapes: that way of cataloging property peculiar to the landscape tradition. But then, if you look carefully at the details, you\'ll see abandoned cars, debris – a slightly devastated landscape that otherwise appears to be pastoral.\r\n\r\nLC: You have examined the context through a specific medium as well as through the conventions of a particular genre. By contrast, in the film you\'ll represent it in completely different sets of terms – well, not completely...\r\n\r\nSD: I can be a lot more diachronic in the film. I mean, I can deal with time in the film, which photographs don\'t lend themselves to as easily. The film has an open-ended time that folds in on itself. That\'s partly derived from working with the orchestral score, the Schoenberg score, which has been reduced to piano. It\'s like the classic post-Sophocles narrative of beginning, middle, and end – pursuit, fear, catastrophe – which is typical of Western culture. Yet, by the end, the musical material has diverged so far from its origin that it\'s without resolution or rest. The story, too, leaves itself open. At the end there is a character who has the possibility of discrediting the policemen and the investigation – or, though he probably hasn\'t got the power to do that, he at least knows where his roommate has gone.\r\n\r\nLC: The Schoenberg score was for an imaginary film, not for an actual film, wasn\'t it? And the diary entries with which the film opens are based on actual historical records, which you consulted but did not literally transcribe...\r\n\r\nSD: In those two sequences of diary entries some are direct quotes – but with the names changed – of actual entries from the Ruskin area, and others were invented to make the narrative flow.\r\n\r\nLC: There\'s an interesting relationship between the Schoenberg score, which did not accompany a real film, and this material which is quasi-documentary. In both there is a slippage, either between fact and fiction, or between the real and the imaginary, so that these oppositional categories no longer seem to pertain. The possibility of moving between them allows you to open the film itself up for investigation. Is this similar in some way to what occurs in “Subject to a Film: Marnie”, where, if I\'ve got it right, the only sound in the film happens at the moment when the woman in the deserted office reaches with her gloved hand to unlock the safe? Is the click on the soundtrack not that of the combination lock, but a noise produced from the suture on the film\'s loop?\r\n\r\nSD: Yes, but the suture happens just before that – when she finds the safe combination and closes the drawer. There\'s a similar scene in “Pursuit, Fear, Catastrophe...” a little dream sequence where suddenly the exterior is contemporary, where what you thought was a cabin throughout the entire film is revealed as a trailer court, and you see the contemporary police car coming up to Theodore\'s cabin. It\'s played across a dream sequence: he\'s sleeping, tossing and turning. The camera cuts from inside to outside. Then, after the digression, the film returns to 1930 again [...]\r\n\r\nLC: When you [refer to] \'poetic resonance\', do you mean something like a space for imaginative play – a space for exploring areas of the mind that don\'t often come into consciousness in other arenas of experience?\r\n\r\nSD: At a very blunt level I would consider poetic resonance to be like the harmonic relationship in a piece of music. It\'s not like the melody which would go horizontally and has a beginning, middle, and end, referring to past moments, or anticipating future ones. The harmonic or poetic resonance goes elsewhere, allowing an audience to have other kinds of engagement with the work. I tend to describe a work in terms of what materials are used, and of what references are there. I shy away from interpreting it because if the audience had no way of finding a language of its own to understand a project, then that project is unsuccessful. I may as well have just written on a piece of paper a statement staying, \'I mean this.\'\r\n\r\nLC: When you\'re talking about poetic resonance is there any difference between the television and gallery works?\r\n\r\nSD No, it\'s the same process of poesis. Poesis also happens on that real vernacular level. Those forms – like genre movies, which are supposedly domineering and meant to over-determine one\'s response or relationship to them – are still received by audiences in ways that market research can\'t predict – although there are, of course, preferred meanings, which it does everything in its power to have accepted as being true or natural in some way.

What this typically amounted to was the destruction of inner city neighbourhoods in favour of new housing projects and the creation of new towns on the outskirts: suburbanization of the middle class and concentration of the working class in the old city centres. This had a devastating effect on a lot of US cities, as the tax base was withdrawn to new towns, and the projects that erased old neighbourhoods were more often than not poorly conceived and constructed. One of the strangest things about this phenomena is that it was perhaps the most comprehensive application of modernist principles to urban planning; however absolutely compromised. Developers used modernistic devices as a means to cut costs, while architects using industrial techniques usually ended up making homes for the wealthy, and the trickle-down vanguardism they imagined never really took place. \r\n\r\nIn Vancouver, the city wanted to completely raze its oldest neighbourhood, putting in its place a sort of Corbusian working class compound, and then zone the area around it for heavy industry. Two of the housing projects got built, but a residents’ group was able to convince the federal and provincial governments to renovate rather than raze the houses and to set up co-operative housing. Mind is a sort of a sci-fi piece in which the city’s original plan has been completed. Two men sharing an apartment are having an antagonistic conversation, which blossoms into a fist fight. They get tired and stop, there is a pause, then the whole thing loops. The six-minute scene was shot from ten points of view on either side of the cinematic axis. When installed, the two axis sides are projected on two adjacent 3m x 4m screens and a computer re-cuts the montage in real time so that each time the action loops the points of view are fundamentally different, and it will take about 15 hours or so for it to repeat itself. The work is about the control of space: in the housing project, in the axis convention which is here split open, and in the hellish Sysiphian conflict itself. \r\n\r\nJB: In recent works, such as “Der Sandmann” and “Nu•tka•”, your treatment of film or video as a language has resulted in the creation of binaries that occasionally, cyclically merge: two pans of the Schrebergarten in two different time periods—where a dreadful memory lurks for narrator Nathaniel—take turns in ‘wiping’ each other out; two images of Nootka Sound come together as the overlapping voices of Spanish commandant Martinez and British captain Colnett are synchronized, explaining their apprehensions about arriving at the Canadian West Coast. These pieces both deal explicitly with the ‘return of the repressed’—but this return is apparent in other works as well, for example: “Pursuit, Feat Catastrophe: Ruskin B.C”. (in that it returns to a rather unsavoury moment of Canadian history). How conscious are you, before you set out to make a work, of wanting to create re-readings or double readings of histories?\r\n\r\nSD: The trope of the double has become embarrassingly apparent to me over the last few years but I did at least come by in honestly. It has been something that has ‘just appeared’ over the course of research. But I suppose with two parallel streams of image or sound, you have the minimum number of voices necessary for polyphony or conflict. \r\n\r\nWith regard to the research itself, I certainly do start out wanting to re-read or reconsider the history of a particular location. I never exactly know what I’m looking for, but it always begins with being fascinated with a site: by the Gothic power house at Ruskin, the Schrebergarten surrounding Berlin or by the industrial landscape of the north-west coast. Usually I’m intrigued by a locale that is in some way at odds with itself, uncanny, and my job then is to find out how it came to be that way. I tend to have an affinity with the minor histories of a place, things that might even be invisible to people who live there. So the ‘return of the repressed’ in some instances might even have to do with a repressed history, as with the legacy of free jazz in “Hors-champs”. \r\n\r\nJB: You work with video and film, media that are most widely used to reach mass audiences, and whose productions—TV programs and movies—are often “obsessed with their own internal logic.” (I’m paraphrasing you on “Happy Talk News”). Yet, many of your close friends in Vancouver are poets, people who are not just obsessed with the shifting of commas, but in extracting meaning from details and deconstructing language and its formulas. (I might also add that poets generally work for audiences that are even smaller than those for the visual arts). How do ideas of poetry inform your own work, which has to deal with both images and language, or images and sound?\r\n\r\nSD: In a very literal way, knowing the writers that I do helped me learn how to talk about my work. There is a writer’s collective in Vancouver called the Kootenay School of Writing which, in the early 1980s, had moved down to Vancouver from the interior city of Nelson BC after the college they were a part of had been shut down by a conservative provincial government. Over time, their workshops became less prominent than their readings and exhibitions (there was then an art gallery associated with KSW, Artspeak, first run collectively, then by a curator named Cate Rimmer). In the mid 1980s they held a series of lectures called Artists/Writers/Talks. The name is pretty self-explanatory: The writers and artist who hung around together at readings and opening were invited to explain their work to one another in a more or less formal setting. I really didn’t enjoy art school that much—as elsewhere, aside from NSCAD* I suppose, there was a strong prejudice against language and theory among most of the students and much of the faculty. These talks were the firs time that I found myself in a conversational community larger than handful of friends where we were able to hash out ideas over an extended period of time. \r\n\r\nThe writers at KSW were varied. Some wrote prose fiction, but the majority were poets, usually avoiding the institution of Canadian Literature by either looking to the post-war US modernists or, especially, by an engagement with the so-called L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E School of the late 1970s. They would no doubt hate this, but you could call Language Writing a sort-of anti-humanist lyric poetry which, for moments, effaces subjectivity in an attempt to make language itself speak. The Television Spots and Monodramas incorporated this idea in the fact that they broadcast anonymously. The last thing I wanted people to think was that what they were seeing was art: in order to be effective or productive, it had to appear that television itself had begun to confuse its strict conventions. I think the contact with poetry is also where I became interested in vernaculars of representation—something nascent in the television pieces, and more fully articulated in the installations from 1992—the idea that different cultures will make very different use (articulations) of the same medium (language) from region to region. \r\n\r\nJB: Michel Foucault said that “language is the first and last structure of madness.” Do you agree?\r\n\r\nSD: If I understand this remark, it means that madness is invisible until there is a language to describe it—much like the history of sexuality Foucault recounts in his late work, where certain sexualities did not exist until they were ‘invented’ by discourse in the late nineteenth century. Reading books like “Discipline and Punish” certainly influenced my interest in vernaculars of representation—and the idea that as a language disappears the things that it was invented to describe disappear also. In “Evening Happy Talk News” the theatricalization of television news programs and its alignment with entertainment did away with dry, paternalistic news reading but also reduced the amount of editorializing that wasn’t just opinion. When there is a paradigm shift, the new paradigm isn’t necessarily better just because it is newer, and vice versa. \r\n\r\nJB: Would you describe your work as ‘mannerist’, in the way, say, that Robert Smithson define Hitchcock’s and Eisenstein’s films as mannerist (disclosing or recovering a sense of primal evil), or the way Brecht contrived always to achieve an ‘alienating effect’?\r\n\r\nSD: The words ‘primal’ and ‘mannerist’ don’t really sound right together. And even though I don’t recognize the quote, and I’m not exactly sure of its context, I guess mannerism is what happens when an old paradigm of representation begins to lose its transparency and its forms can be put to new uses. This is what happened in Mannerism proper vis à vis the Renaissance, and it’s what happened to modernism in the post-war period. People talk about high modernism in, say, Ad Reinhardt or Joseph Kosuth but this work had very little to do with the pre-war avant-garde because there was little social relationship and no sense of the future; because it was art obsessed with art. Formal transformations of artistic institutions were proposed, and the attenuation of meaning resulted. \r\n\r\nJB: You’re talking about pre-war art being art-obsessed, right?\r\n\r\nSD: Ah, well, no, I thought I was saying exactly the opposite: that pre-war modernism was engaged with meaning in the world and the transformation of how meaning could be made in the future, whereas the post-war practice I indicated was obsessed with the institution of art as an enclosed, autonomous system. The alienation effect, for example, offered a transformed sense of spectatorship—an attitude, really—which the audience could take home with them. But if an artist is only concerned with defining or expanding the boundaries of the category of art then their work becomes mannerist in the negative sense. This happened with a lot of conceptual art in the 1970s and more recent morbid symptoms are those varieties of so-called public art which appropriate public discourses to the art world without reciprocity. But of course even the “Three Penny Opera” was ruined by its own success: you can hear it each time “Mack the Knife” is sung without its original violence and irony.\r\n\r\nJB: In 1988 you organized the exhibition “Samuel Beckett: Teleplays” for the Vancouver Art Gallery, which included Beckett’s “Film” and versions of the seven works he wrote specifically for television. The exhibition travelled and you lectured on Beckett a number of times over the following two years. The way so many of your own works loop, repeat themselves endlessly, is reminiscent of many of Beckett’s works (where “nothing happens, nobody comes, nobody goes, it is terrible,” as Jean Anouilh wrote in praise of Beckett’s most famous play, “Waiting for Godot”). What’s your connection to Beckett and why is he important to you?\r\n\r\nSD: I organized that show basically so I could see the work. I had become interested in Beckett a few years earlier when I picked up one of his books, “Company”, in a store and realized that it had just been published, when I had the impression that Beckett was either dead or in Beckettian silence. You usually only hear about Godot or “Endgame”, but I was particularly struck by his late work in general—the pieces more or less contemporary with the Teleplays—and his prose in particular. I had been taught in school that Beckett was about endings and stalemates, but his writing became for me more of a beginning, a ground zero, the a priori skepticism with which one has to regard language and representation in order to speak while remaining aware of the influence of ideology, for example. \r\n\r\nYes, the looping that is everywhere in my work comes from Beckett, but the primary difference is that in his work structures of words repeat while their utterance changes, and in mine the looping utterance stays the same, by way of mechanical means, while perception of it changes. It’s like polyphonic music: except in memory, you can’t attend to all the voices simultaneously, you have to decide which details to focus on. \r\n\r\nJB: Finally, I wanted to ask: between Ruskin, B.C. and Schönberg’s 12-tone system, the Schrebergarten and now Strathcona in Vancouver, you’ve done a lot of work about failed utopic projects. What fascinates you about these failures? Do you think you’re any more tuned into this theme coming from B.C. (the whole province is peppered with little colonies of idealists)?\r\n\r\nSD: The failed utopia thing goes much deeper than that—its almost as bad as the double thing—all of the installations I’ve made since 1992 deal with this conundrum in one way or another. Certainly, British Columbia is a province that since the late nineteenth century, was colonized by people looking for an outside, an elsewhere, where they could establish utopian communities based on ethnic, political or religious ideals and this, along with radical exploitation of natural resources, became the local tradition. (But I have to admit that I was pretty ignorant of all that until I began conducting research on Ruskin.) The installations have focused on minor yet pivotal moments in modernity, a moment when society could have gone one way or another. I’m not necessarily nostalgic for these communities, I don’t necessarily agree with what they represented, but I was interested in the fact that a community like a language or culture paradigm becomes a place that makes peculiar ideas possible, and when it disappears those ideas disappear also. \r\n\r\nJEN BUDNEY is a writer living in Milan.\r\n\r\n*NSCAD is the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, in Halifax Canada.

Douglas’s latest offering, “Klatsassin”—a high-definition video that will be screen in abridged form at the Vancouver International Film Festival this month before making its full-fledged debut at the Vienna Secession in November—likewise engages and elaborates a well-known work of cinema. Here the artist refashions Akira Kurosawa’s “Rashomon” (1950), a film famous for its multiple, contradictory accounts of a murder in a woods outside eleventh-century Kyoto, as a western set in nineteenth-century British Columbia. Taking the narrative complexity of Kurosawa’s murder mystery to a logical, if perverse, extreme, “Klatsassin” is Douglas’s most ambitious and perhaps most audacious act of appropriations yet. \r\n\r\nMore ‘Garden of Forking Paths’ than “Gunsmoke,” “Klatsassin,” with its diverse cast that includes a German miner, a prospector and his partner, a thief, a Scottish constable, an English innkeeper, and a Tsîlhqot’in (Chilcotin) prisoner, transforms “Rashomon” into a branching narrative that weaves digressively through five different time periods and multiple, conflicting stories of a murder. To see all 840 permutations unfold, one would have to watch the gallery-bound installation from more than three days.\r\n\r\nIn his ongoing exploration of looping structures, which began with “Overture” in 1986, Douglas has persistently transformed the way one might employ film and video to construct elliptical narratives and unexpected temporal models. Yet for all its technical sophistication and labyrinthine complexity, “Klatsassin” exploits a relatively simple binary opposition: a poetic tension between the repetitive precision of cinematic time and the fluidity of subjective experience—most specifically in the imperfection of human memory. Inscribing this tension in the formal operations of his film, Douglas circles around—and beyond—the raw materials of Kurosawa’s classic to produce a historically based, subtly allegorical western without end.\r\n-Michael Ned Holte\r\n\r\n\r\n1000 Words\r\n\r\nSTAN DOUGLAS Talks About “Klatsassin” 2006\r\n\r\n\r\nI don’t necessarily like westerns as a genre. The idea for “Klatsassin” came from walking in the woods on day, seeing dappled light in the forest, and being reminded of the light in “Rashomon”—during the various recollections of the fight scene. When I saw the film again I realized that the differing versions of the same event were germane to my work. So Kurosawa’s movie became an interesting raw material to work with.\r\n\r\nMany of Kurosawa’s films have been made into westerns. “Yojimbo” became, scene by scene, “A Fist Full of Dollars”; “The Seven Samurai” became “The Magnificent Seven”. And even “Rashomon,” I was dismayed to discover, had been remade as a western called “The Outrage”, starring William Shatner, Edward G. Robinson, and Paul Newman as a Mexican bandit. It’s quite awful. So, in a way, I’m making good to Kurosawa by doing a tribute to “Rashomon” properly. \r\n\r\nThis is a dub western. We have a set of narrative materials that are repeated and recombined to create new variations, which is what happens in dub music, where multiple versions are derived from a single song. The use of a dub track in “Klatsassin,” by Berlin’s Rhythm & Sound, is an analogue to the overall structure of the piece. It’s also a kind of readymade. A readymade is something that is re-contextualized and means something new in that new context—but you still have an idea of what it was in its original context, so it can be two things at the same time. It can be polyphonic.\r\n\r\nMy film is set in the time of a native insurgency that took place in British Columbia in 1864. It was the Tsîlhqot’in nation’s response to a gold rush that had begun midcentury and brought a lot of people from Europe and the United States—and with them, smallpox. This is where Klatsassin, a Tsîlhqot’in chief whose name literally means “we do not know his name,” comes in. With the memory still fresh of an epidemic that took the lives of thousands of natives in the region, many Indians up there didn’t want Europeans crossing their territory. Klatsassin himself led a war party that killed fourteen people in a day. Unable to capture any of the insurgents, the governor sent Klatsassin a gift of tobacco, which the chief interpreted as a peace offering. When he came in to negotiate a treaty to end what he regarded as a war, he was tried for murder, and hanged. Armed escorts transported Chedekki, the only member of the war party left alive, to New Westminster to see if an eyewitness could identify him, but he escaped en route. To this day, no one knows exactly what happened, and that’s where my story begins.\r\n\r\nPrincipal photography was done around Vancouver, and we shot second unit in various places up in an area call the Cariboo. It’s a different landscape than one normally sees in westerns. I researched the languages spoken there in the nineteenth century, and I looked at the history of this area—the way people dressed, the way they interacted, where they came from, and so on. In “Klatsassin,” I don’t think any two characters are the same nationality or speak the same language. They’re all from different places, scrambling to get their gold. It reminded me of today—people from the US and Europe trying to get the most valuable thing in the world out of the earth in a place where they’re not really welcome. And there was an insurgency. And a prisoner with a bag over his head.\r\n\r\nOften we see in galleries motion pictures that have a beginning and an end—linear films that are made to repeat. I first proposed a looping idea in 1986, in “Overture”, which really is a loop: There’s no beginning and no end. Other looping pieces, like “Subject to a Film Marnie” and “Der Sandmann,” 1995, have a semblance of linear narrative, beginning and end, but mostly it’s all middle. With the recombinant pieces, such as “Journey into Fear and Suspiria,” it’s taken to a new level. These works change over time, and often very long intervals pass before they repeat themselves; they are branching narratives, no longer linear or one-dimensional. It’s a matter of extending the possibilities of temporal form far beyond the ninety-minute, three-act dramatic structure Hollywood loves. \r\n\r\nMy most complex recombinant work would be “Suspiria,” which lasts so long it might as well be infinite. It is comedic but also quite complicated and it takes maybe an hour for the viewer to understand what’s going on. In “Klatsassin” the structure is apparent after ten or fifteen minutes, but it takes days for all the permutations to play out. And that makes it virtually impossible for two different viewers to see the same thing the same way—much like the characters in “Rashomon”. \r\n								\r\nARTFORUM, October 2006\r\n',NULL),(146,1,'2015-06-08 20:59:03','2020-11-24 01:31:59',4,'\"Television Spots and Melodramas\" 1987â€“1991',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'television-spots-and-melodramas-1987a-1991',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '\"Television Spots and Melodramas\" 1987–1991',_binary '<iframe width=\"854\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/R8e4tJo183E\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>',NULL),(147,1,'2015-06-08 20:59:52','2020-11-24 01:31:59',5,'Details for \"Inconsolable Memories\" ',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'details-for-inconsolable-memories',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Details for \"Inconsolable Memories\" ',_binary '<iframe width=\"854\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KFpX7WuNvb4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>',NULL),(148,1,'2015-06-10 11:06:47','2015-06-10 11:06:47',NULL,'Untitled',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'<iframe width=\"854\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GtW2hAxaFHY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'','',NULL),(149,1,'2015-09-15 09:44:19','2020-11-24 01:31:59',2,'Recontextualization + Ronin',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'recontextualization-ronin',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Recontextualization + Ronin',_binary 'RECONTEXTUALIZATION + RONIN:\r\nOne approach to the western in Stan Douglas\'s film \"Klatsassin\"\r\nMark Berrettini\r\nThursday, September 17, 7-9pm \r\nTickets $5 General, $3 Students, artists, seniors\r\n\r\nStan Douglas has reinvented significant works of cinema, from his looping six-minute, 16-mm work Subject to a Film: Marnie (1989) which follows closely from Hitchcock’s 1964 original, to Suspiria (2002/2003), a recombinant video mix of elements borrowed from Dario Argento’s cult classic of the same name.

Mark Berrettini discusses the debate about the relationship between American Westerns and Japanese Samurai films that has circulated through film scholarship related to popular film genres for several decades. The talk will draw on this context and genre/narrative methods to consider how Stan Douglas\'s Klatsassin moves the Western-Samurai relationship into another arena as he radically reinterprets Akira Kurosawa\'s Rashomon (1950) set outside eleventh-century Kyoto within a Pacific Northwest(ern) period film. \r\n \r\nDr. Mark L.

What he finds in Beckett’s oeuvre is not a bleak tragicomic outlook on existence, but an affirmation of the possibility for new subjectivities that are not modeled on Eurocentric capitalist archetypes. In juxtaposing Douglas’s Mime video with Beckett’s Not I, we will be interested in the similarities between their meditations on the possibility and impossibility of telling one’s own story with and through the mask that is the face. If Mime is characterized by paranoia or even self-disavowal, Douglas’s retelling of the nineteenth-century German writer E. T. A. Hoffmann’s Der Sandmann asks what it would mean for the film screen itself to be beset by feelings of the uncanny. This piece also reveals the degree to which Douglas, like Hoffmann and Beckett, is fascinated by the ghostly hybrids that emerge at the intersections of verbal, visual and auditory media. \r\n\r\nJan Mieszkowski is Professor of German and Comparative Literature at Reed College.

C. where he lives and works. Douglas studied at Emily Carr College of Art, Vancouver. A conceptual artist, Stan Douglas uses film, video, photography, slide projection, music, literature, and, most recently, theatre to construct subtle and layered meditations on history and cultural identity. A passionate reader and devoted researcher with wide interests, Douglas understands history as a string of contingencies, marked by a fascination with those moments when historical events might have taken a different turn. In posing questions about particular locations or events, he constructs local histories in the guise of newly imagined narratives. \r\n<br><br>\r\nWorking within the language and vocabulary of pre-existing mediums including silent film, news broadcasting, musical entertainment, television programs and the theatre stage, Douglas is well-known for a body of film and photographic works including \"Hors Champs\" (1992); \"Der Sandmann\" (1995); \"Journey Into Fear\" (2001); \"Cuba\" (2004); \"Midcentury Studio\" (2010); and his six hour film, \"Luanda Kinshasa\" (2014). Opening in Canada in 2014, \"Helen Lawrence\" launched Douglas’ foray into multi-media theatre. \r\n<br><br>\r\nStan Douglas’s films, videos and photographs have been seen in exhibitions internationally, including Documentas IX, X, and XI (1992, 1997, 2002) and three Venice Biennales (1990, 2001, 2005). Solo exhibitions of his work have been have been presented by prominent museums in Europe and North America and a comprehensive survey, \"Past Imperfect: Works 1986–2007,\" was mounted by the Württembergischer Kunstverein and Staatsgalerie, Stuttgart in 2007. In 1986 he organized a touring exhibition of Samuel Beckett’s media works for the Vancouver Art Gallery, \"Samuel Beckett: Teleplays,\" and in 2006 curated \"Beyond Cinema: Art of Projection\" for the Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin. An exhibition of work since 2008 opened at the Carré d’art at Nîmes in 2013 and will tour Europe through 2015.

Mark Berrettini discusses the debate about the relationship between American Westerns and Japanese Samurai films that has circulated through film scholarship related to popular film genres for several decades. The talk will draw on this context and genre/narrative methods to consider how Stan Douglas\'s Klatsassin moves the Western-Samurai relationship into another arena as he radically reinterprets Akira Kurosawa\'s Rashomon (1950) set outside eleventh-century Kyoto within a Pacific Northwest(ern) period film. \r\n <br><br>\r\nDr. Mark L.

What he finds in Beckett’s oeuvre is not a bleak tragicomic outlook on existence, but an affirmation of the possibility for new subjectivities that are not modeled on Eurocentric capitalist archetypes. In juxtaposing Douglas’s Mime video with Beckett’s Not I, we will be interested in the similarities between their meditations on the possibility and impossibility of telling one’s own story with and through the mask that is the face. If Mime is characterized by paranoia or even self-disavowal, Douglas’s retelling of the nineteenth-century German writer E. T. A. Hoffmann’s Der Sandmann asks what it would mean for the film screen itself to be beset by feelings of the uncanny. This piece also reveals the degree to which Douglas, like Hoffmann and Beckett, is fascinated by the ghostly hybrids that emerge at the intersections of verbal, visual and auditory media. \r\n<br><br>\r\nJan Mieszkowski is Professor of German and Comparative Literature at Reed College.

One instance of that would be your essay in the catalogue to an exhibition of Beckett teleplays, which you curated in 1988. In it you argue that in place of a closed world like Sade\'s, which is invented to be mastered, Beckett \'imagines an uncertain one: the residence of even less certain subjectivity.\' Another would be your proclivity for film loops, as in “Overture”, thus not only making the piece continuous, but divesting it of a climax. There\'s a related avoidance of narrative resolution in the film script for “Pursuit, Fear, Catastrophe: Ruskin, BC”. Do you regard this as a philosophical position or part of your aesthetic?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSTAN DOUGLAS: Both in terms of presentation and the subject matter of my work, I have been preoccupied with failed utopias and obsolete technologies. To a large degree, my concern is not to redeem these past events but to reconsider them: to understand why these utopian moments did not fulfill themselves, what larger forces kept a local moment a minor moment: and what was valuable there – what might still be useful today. In both the gallery pieces and the TV pieces I\'m looking at supposedly inconsequential moments of life. Yet these are perhaps the most significant ones, because they are the ones where habit is predominant, where people aren\'t strictly attending to how they\'re behaving. So, in the narratives of the TV projects, and also in the more thematically structured gallery works, I\'m trying to reconsider what has been either a habitual discarding of personal habit or a larger cultural one, in as much as cultural forces go through the same process.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLC: What led you to these media? How did you end up working primarily with reproductive technologies?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: Part of it is the fact that I can\'t draw. But it\'s often also the result of trying to find the appropriate medium for the subject matter of the work. I learned quite a bit about these different media trying to make the projects as different from each other as possible. A certain subject will eventually draw me to a particular medium. Since I\'m interested in the cultural and the psychological effects as well as the social situation of television broadcasting, I have to work with the medium of television itself. The player piano piece, “Onomatopoeia”, is concerned with evoking certain historical moments, and certain notions of absence, which the very formal presentation both embodies and represents at the same time.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLC: When you say you can\'t draw, is that a consequence of your art school training?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: I did go to art school, where I did a little bit of drafting and technical drawing. But I was just too lazy to learn how to draw. \r\n<br><br>\r\nLC: Does this reinforce your tendency to write?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: That has evolved with the projects. Developing them by way of notes and textual research, as well as reading a lot, gave me various models of how to write, and eventually I began doing it myself. The essay for the Beckett catalogue was the first essay I had ever written: it was out of necessity.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLC: How do you find your subject?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: It\'s always quite by accident. With the Ruskin works, for example, I had gone on a boating trip with some friends during which we came upon an extraordinary site: a power station built in 1930, which looks like a vampire\'s château set in the landscape. Next to it there is a very well-tended second-growth forest maintained by a regional hydro company, as well as a somewhat devastated runoff area. What\'s left of the Stave River is flanked on one side by wealthy holiday homes and on the other side by small lumber mills and a couple of trailer courts. The name \'Ruskin\' made me curious about it. I learned that it was originally established as a Ruskinian utopian community, which failed after only two years of operation. Since then it has been the site of various small local communities, none of which lasted very long. Around 1900, business ventures and later, a large Japanese community formed there until the internment during World War II, when they were declared \'enemy aliens\', and their land was expropriated by the government. “Pursuit, Fear, Catastrophe: Ruskin, BC” developed out of finding this location, and being fascinated by it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLC: Have those who were interned fought to be recompensed? Is a political issue implicit in the work?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: About five years ago, after years of lobbying, there was a redress in Canada. But monetary recompense for the internment, for that injustice, can only be symbolic. And it\'s very, very difficult to find out who was in that community, because the purpose of internment was to destroy the social fabric of the Japanese-Canadian community. It was a community of ex-guest workers – all of whom were therefore de facto Canadians – who were developing their own social relationships with the country. The purpose of the internment was to break up those communities and to leave them no possibility of having any solid social ground. It\'s only recently that people have been able to reconstruct the whole fabric – their relationships and families. Indirectly, the film-script bears upon this, in that two policemen seem quite happy to discredit the reputation of the Japanese man, and his race as a whole.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWhen I did the research for this project, I went to the provincial archives and looked at the daily diaries of constables working in this area and of the others working in very isolated areas. Part of their job in the 1930s was to keep the different racial groups separate, preventing any kind of coalition that might cause a social or economic threat to the status quo. Everybody was catalogued by race. The Japanese, Chinese, \'Hindoos\' – spelled with two o\'s – Jews, and Italians etc., were all categorized as other to the Anglo-Saxon majority. This is presented in the film in what seems a nonchalant, matter of fact manner. That was how they went about the business of containing these different racial groups.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLC: It\'s automatic: routine rather than considered behaviour.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: Exactly.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLC: In “Pursuit, Fear, Catastrophe...” you are dealing with the material in two different forms. There is the group of colour photographs with two text panels, which has already been exhibited, and then there\'s the film that you\'re currently making. How do the two compare? On a previous occasion you also developed the same body of material into quite different idioms, didn\'t you?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: Yes. Those location photographs are part of my process of going out and considering the site. In assembling them into a work for exhibition I was trying to make slightly decrepit sites around Ruskin look like nineteenth-century English landscapes: that way of cataloging property peculiar to the landscape tradition. But then, if you look carefully at the details, you\'ll see abandoned cars, debris – a slightly devastated landscape that otherwise appears to be pastoral.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLC: You have examined the context through a specific medium as well as through the conventions of a particular genre. By contrast, in the film you\'ll represent it in completely different sets of terms – well, not completely...\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: I can be a lot more diachronic in the film. I mean, I can deal with time in the film, which photographs don\'t lend themselves to as easily. The film has an open-ended time that folds in on itself. That\'s partly derived from working with the orchestral score, the Schoenberg score, which has been reduced to piano. It\'s like the classic post-Sophocles narrative of beginning, middle, and end – pursuit, fear, catastrophe – which is typical of Western culture. Yet, by the end, the musical material has diverged so far from its origin that it\'s without resolution or rest. The story, too, leaves itself open. At the end there is a character who has the possibility of discrediting the policemen and the investigation – or, though he probably hasn\'t got the power to do that, he at least knows where his roommate has gone.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLC: The Schoenberg score was for an imaginary film, not for an actual film, wasn\'t it? And the diary entries with which the film opens are based on actual historical records, which you consulted but did not literally transcribe...\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: In those two sequences of diary entries some are direct quotes – but with the names changed – of actual entries from the Ruskin area, and others were invented to make the narrative flow.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLC: There\'s an interesting relationship between the Schoenberg score, which did not accompany a real film, and this material which is quasi-documentary. In both there is a slippage, either between fact and fiction, or between the real and the imaginary, so that these oppositional categories no longer seem to pertain. The possibility of moving between them allows you to open the film itself up for investigation. Is this similar in some way to what occurs in “Subject to a Film: Marnie”, where, if I\'ve got it right, the only sound in the film happens at the moment when the woman in the deserted office reaches with her gloved hand to unlock the safe? Is the click on the soundtrack not that of the combination lock, but a noise produced from the suture on the film\'s loop?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: Yes, but the suture happens just before that – when she finds the safe combination and closes the drawer. There\'s a similar scene in “Pursuit, Fear, Catastrophe...” a little dream sequence where suddenly the exterior is contemporary, where what you thought was a cabin throughout the entire film is revealed as a trailer court, and you see the contemporary police car coming up to Theodore\'s cabin. It\'s played across a dream sequence: he\'s sleeping, tossing and turning. The camera cuts from inside to outside. Then, after the digression, the film returns to 1930 again [...]\r\n<br><br>\r\nLC: When you [refer to] \'poetic resonance\', do you mean something like a space for imaginative play – a space for exploring areas of the mind that don\'t often come into consciousness in other arenas of experience?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: At a very blunt level I would consider poetic resonance to be like the harmonic relationship in a piece of music. It\'s not like the melody which would go horizontally and has a beginning, middle, and end, referring to past moments, or anticipating future ones. The harmonic or poetic resonance goes elsewhere, allowing an audience to have other kinds of engagement with the work. I tend to describe a work in terms of what materials are used, and of what references are there. I shy away from interpreting it because if the audience had no way of finding a language of its own to understand a project, then that project is unsuccessful. I may as well have just written on a piece of paper a statement staying, \'I mean this.\'\r\n<br><br>\r\nLC: When you\'re talking about poetic resonance is there any difference between the television and gallery works?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD No, it\'s the same process of poesis. Poesis also happens on that real vernacular level. Those forms – like genre movies, which are supposedly domineering and meant to over-determine one\'s response or relationship to them – are still received by audiences in ways that market research can\'t predict – although there are, of course, preferred meanings, which it does everything in its power to have accepted as being true or natural in some way. I prefer to have respect for an audience, and to allow it to participate in the construction of meaning.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFRIEZE, September/October, 1993\r\n',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(160,1,'2015-12-08 20:27:38','2021-05-25 21:14:48',2,'The Failed Utopia',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'the-failed-utopia',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Jen Budney and Stan Douglas',_binary '\r\n																								JEN BUDNEY: What are you working on now?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSTAN DOUGLAS: I just finished shooting a new piece called “Win, Place or Show” set in Strathcona, the neighbourhood in which I live in Vancouver. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThis city, like every other urban centre in North America, went through a building boom in the post-war period. In the jargon of the day, city councillors wanted to sponsor ‘urban renewal’ to do away with ‘urban blight’. What this typically amounted to was the destruction of inner city neighbourhoods in favour of new housing projects and the creation of new towns on the outskirts: suburbanization of the middle class and concentration of the working class in the old city centres. This had a devastating effect on a lot of US cities, as the tax base was withdrawn to new towns, and the projects that erased old neighbourhoods were more often than not poorly conceived and constructed. One of the strangest things about this phenomena is that it was perhaps the most comprehensive application of modernist principles to urban planning; however absolutely compromised. Developers used modernistic devices as a means to cut costs, while architects using industrial techniques usually ended up making homes for the wealthy, and the trickle-down vanguardism they imagined never really took place. \r\n<br><br>\r\nIn Vancouver, the city wanted to completely raze its oldest neighbourhood, putting in its place a sort of Corbusian working class compound, and then zone the area around it for heavy industry. Two of the housing projects got built, but a residents’ group was able to convince the federal and provincial governments to renovate rather than raze the houses and to set up co-operative housing. Mind is a sort of a sci-fi piece in which the city’s original plan has been completed. Two men sharing an apartment are having an antagonistic conversation, which blossoms into a fist fight. They get tired and stop, there is a pause, then the whole thing loops. The six-minute scene was shot from ten points of view on either side of the cinematic axis. When installed, the two axis sides are projected on two adjacent 3m x 4m screens and a computer re-cuts the montage in real time so that each time the action loops the points of view are fundamentally different, and it will take about 15 hours or so for it to repeat itself. The work is about the control of space: in the housing project, in the axis convention which is here split open, and in the hellish Sysiphian conflict itself. \r\n<br><br>\r\nJB: In recent works, such as “Der Sandmann” and “Nu•tka•”, your treatment of film or video as a language has resulted in the creation of binaries that occasionally, cyclically merge: two pans of the Schrebergarten in two different time periods—where a dreadful memory lurks for narrator Nathaniel—take turns in ‘wiping’ each other out; two images of Nootka Sound come together as the overlapping voices of Spanish commandant Martinez and British captain Colnett are synchronized, explaining their apprehensions about arriving at the Canadian West Coast. These pieces both deal explicitly with the ‘return of the repressed’—but this return is apparent in other works as well, for example: “Pursuit, Feat Catastrophe: Ruskin B.C”. (in that it returns to a rather unsavoury moment of Canadian history). How conscious are you, before you set out to make a work, of wanting to create re-readings or double readings of histories?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: The trope of the double has become embarrassingly apparent to me over the last few years but I did at least come by in honestly. It has been something that has ‘just appeared’ over the course of research. But I suppose with two parallel streams of image or sound, you have the minimum number of voices necessary for polyphony or conflict. \r\n<br><br>\r\nWith regard to the research itself, I certainly do start out wanting to re-read or reconsider the history of a particular location. I never exactly know what I’m looking for, but it always begins with being fascinated with a site: by the Gothic power house at Ruskin, the Schrebergarten surrounding Berlin or by the industrial landscape of the north-west coast. Usually I’m intrigued by a locale that is in some way at odds with itself, uncanny, and my job then is to find out how it came to be that way. I tend to have an affinity with the minor histories of a place, things that might even be invisible to people who live there. So the ‘return of the repressed’ in some instances might even have to do with a repressed history, as with the legacy of free jazz in “Hors-champs”. \r\n<br><br>\r\nJB: You work with video and film, media that are most widely used to reach mass audiences, and whose productions—TV programs and movies—are often “obsessed with their own internal logic.” (I’m paraphrasing you on “Happy Talk News”). Yet, many of your close friends in Vancouver are poets, people who are not just obsessed with the shifting of commas, but in extracting meaning from details and deconstructing language and its formulas. (I might also add that poets generally work for audiences that are even smaller than those for the visual arts). How do ideas of poetry inform your own work, which has to deal with both images and language, or images and sound?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: In a very literal way, knowing the writers that I do helped me learn how to talk about my work. There is a writer’s collective in Vancouver called the Kootenay School of Writing which, in the early 1980s, had moved down to Vancouver from the interior city of Nelson BC after the college they were a part of had been shut down by a conservative provincial government. Over time, their workshops became less prominent than their readings and exhibitions (there was then an art gallery associated with KSW, Artspeak, first run collectively, then by a curator named Cate Rimmer). In the mid 1980s they held a series of lectures called Artists/Writers/Talks. The name is pretty self-explanatory: The writers and artist who hung around together at readings and opening were invited to explain their work to one another in a more or less formal setting. I really didn’t enjoy art school that much—as elsewhere, aside from NSCAD* I suppose, there was a strong prejudice against language and theory among most of the students and much of the faculty. These talks were the firs time that I found myself in a conversational community larger than handful of friends where we were able to hash out ideas over an extended period of time. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe writers at KSW were varied. Some wrote prose fiction, but the majority were poets, usually avoiding the institution of Canadian Literature by either looking to the post-war US modernists or, especially, by an engagement with the so-called L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E School of the late 1970s. They would no doubt hate this, but you could call Language Writing a sort-of anti-humanist lyric poetry which, for moments, effaces subjectivity in an attempt to make language itself speak. The Television Spots and Monodramas incorporated this idea in the fact that they broadcast anonymously. The last thing I wanted people to think was that what they were seeing was art: in order to be effective or productive, it had to appear that television itself had begun to confuse its strict conventions. I think the contact with poetry is also where I became interested in vernaculars of representation—something nascent in the television pieces, and more fully articulated in the installations from 1992—the idea that different cultures will make very different use (articulations) of the same medium (language) from region to region. \r\n<br><br>\r\nJB: Michel Foucault said that “language is the first and last structure of madness.” Do you agree?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: If I understand this remark, it means that madness is invisible until there is a language to describe it—much like the history of sexuality Foucault recounts in his late work, where certain sexualities did not exist until they were ‘invented’ by discourse in the late nineteenth century. Reading books like “Discipline and Punish” certainly influenced my interest in vernaculars of representation—and the idea that as a language disappears the things that it was invented to describe disappear also. In “Evening Happy Talk News” the theatricalization of television news programs and its alignment with entertainment did away with dry, paternalistic news reading but also reduced the amount of editorializing that wasn’t just opinion. When there is a paradigm shift, the new paradigm isn’t necessarily better just because it is newer, and vice versa. \r\n<br><br>\r\nJB: Would you describe your work as ‘mannerist’, in the way, say, that Robert Smithson define Hitchcock’s and Eisenstein’s films as mannerist (disclosing or recovering a sense of primal evil), or the way Brecht contrived always to achieve an ‘alienating effect’?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: The words ‘primal’ and ‘mannerist’ don’t really sound right together. And even though I don’t recognize the quote, and I’m not exactly sure of its context, I guess mannerism is what happens when an old paradigm of representation begins to lose its transparency and its forms can be put to new uses. This is what happened in Mannerism proper vis à vis the Renaissance, and it’s what happened to modernism in the post-war period. People talk about high modernism in, say, Ad Reinhardt or Joseph Kosuth but this work had very little to do with the pre-war avant-garde because there was little social relationship and no sense of the future; because it was art obsessed with art. Formal transformations of artistic institutions were proposed, and the attenuation of meaning resulted. \r\n<br><br>\r\nJB: You’re talking about pre-war art being art-obsessed, right?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: Ah, well, no, I thought I was saying exactly the opposite: that pre-war modernism was engaged with meaning in the world and the transformation of how meaning could be made in the future, whereas the post-war practice I indicated was obsessed with the institution of art as an enclosed, autonomous system. The alienation effect, for example, offered a transformed sense of spectatorship—an attitude, really—which the audience could take home with them. But if an artist is only concerned with defining or expanding the boundaries of the category of art then their work becomes mannerist in the negative sense. This happened with a lot of conceptual art in the 1970s and more recent morbid symptoms are those varieties of so-called public art which appropriate public discourses to the art world without reciprocity. But of course even the “Three Penny Opera” was ruined by its own success: you can hear it each time “Mack the Knife” is sung without its original violence and irony.\r\n<br><br>\r\nJB: In 1988 you organized the exhibition “Samuel Beckett: Teleplays” for the Vancouver Art Gallery, which included Beckett’s “Film” and versions of the seven works he wrote specifically for television. The exhibition travelled and you lectured on Beckett a number of times over the following two years. The way so many of your own works loop, repeat themselves endlessly, is reminiscent of many of Beckett’s works (where “nothing happens, nobody comes, nobody goes, it is terrible,” as Jean Anouilh wrote in praise of Beckett’s most famous play, “Waiting for Godot”). What’s your connection to Beckett and why is he important to you?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: I organized that show basically so I could see the work. I had become interested in Beckett a few years earlier when I picked up one of his books, “Company”, in a store and realized that it had just been published, when I had the impression that Beckett was either dead or in Beckettian silence. You usually only hear about Godot or “Endgame”, but I was particularly struck by his late work in general—the pieces more or less contemporary with the Teleplays—and his prose in particular. I had been taught in school that Beckett was about endings and stalemates, but his writing became for me more of a beginning, a ground zero, the a priori skepticism with which one has to regard language and representation in order to speak while remaining aware of the influence of ideology, for example. \r\n<br><br>\r\nYes, the looping that is everywhere in my work comes from Beckett, but the primary difference is that in his work structures of words repeat while their utterance changes, and in mine the looping utterance stays the same, by way of mechanical means, while perception of it changes. It’s like polyphonic music: except in memory, you can’t attend to all the voices simultaneously, you have to decide which details to focus on. \r\n<br><br>\r\nJB: Finally, I wanted to ask: between Ruskin, B.C. and Schönberg’s 12-tone system, the Schrebergarten and now Strathcona in Vancouver, you’ve done a lot of work about failed utopic projects. What fascinates you about these failures? Do you think you’re any more tuned into this theme coming from B.C. (the whole province is peppered with little colonies of idealists)?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: The failed utopia thing goes much deeper than that—its almost as bad as the double thing—all of the installations I’ve made since 1992 deal with this conundrum in one way or another. Certainly, British Columbia is a province that since the late nineteenth century, was colonized by people looking for an outside, an elsewhere, where they could establish utopian communities based on ethnic, political or religious ideals and this, along with radical exploitation of natural resources, became the local tradition. (But I have to admit that I was pretty ignorant of all that until I began conducting research on Ruskin.) The installations have focused on minor yet pivotal moments in modernity, a moment when society could have gone one way or another. I’m not necessarily nostalgic for these communities, I don’t necessarily agree with what they represented, but I was interested in the fact that a community like a language or culture paradigm becomes a place that makes peculiar ideas possible, and when it disappears those ideas disappear also. \r\n<br><br>\r\nJEN BUDNEY is a writer living in Milan.\r\n<br><br>\r\n*NSCAD is the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, in Halifax Canada.

It should come as no surprise that he has made a film reworking the idea behind “Rashomon”, Akira Kurosawa’s 1950 masterpiece. In “Klatsassin” (2006) Douglas constructs a coastal rainforest Western, populated by a cast of unreliable narrators whose multiple accounts of a violent incident are as much a philosophical statement as they are episodes in a film narrative.&nbsp;<br><br>\r\nDouglas understands history as a string of contingencies. This recognition sets an elegiac tone for much of his work, marked by a fascination with those moments when historical events might have taken a different turn. What if the Cuban Revolution, the colonization of Vancouver Island, the political unrest in Paris in May of 1968, had turned out differently? In posing these questions he constructs lost histories in the guise of newly imagined narratives. These re-imaginings reflect on their own conditional nature, and their way of telling mirrors the tale being told. Douglas’ films and videos have no beginning and no end. As he says, ‘life is all middle’.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBefore we talked at his Vancouver studio, Douglas showed me his most recent project, “Vidéo” (2006), which conflates two extant film sources: Samuel Beckett’s “Film” (1965) and Orson Welles’ “The Trial” (1962). Hybridizing the style and tone of his sources, he sets his story in contemporary Paris and comes up with a haunting narrative that insinuates a sense of disturbing watchfulness and past and present danger.<br>\r\n -Robert Enright\r\n<br><br>\r\nROBERT ENRIGHT: How did you come to make “Vidéo” using the two sources you chose?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSTAN DOUGLAS: Early last year I was teaching in Berlin and being harassed, for odd reasons, by the university administration. One evening I was to meet two curators from the Centre Pompidou in Paris to discuss the possibility of me doing a new work for the Beckett exhibition. I had been thinking about Beckett’s “Film” as a kind of cinematic lipogram, in which we never see a reverse shot of the protagonist until the very end, but I didn’t really know what I would do. As I was getting ready to go to the meeting I noticed a copy of Kafka’s “The Trial” (1925) on a bookshelf in the apartment where I was staying and everything clicked: I remembered seeing Orson Welles’ version of “The Trial”, filmed in the derelict Gare D’Orsay and, what I presumed, were the then-new Paris suburbs, then I remembered that I had been staying in the same apartment while the riots were going on in Parisian banlieues during the fall of 2005. Welles actually shot his exteriors among housing projects in Zagreb but I stuck with my original inclination and used locations on the outskirts of Paris. It turned out that the place I was most interested in, La Courneuve, was the site of the most violent demonstrations in November 2005, and the tower I liked best was the fictional home of the heroine in Jean-Luc Godard’s “Two or Three Things I Know about Her” (1967).\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: What’s notable is the way film history is implicated in your making of a film.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: Yes, people often say that it’s impossible to have an original idea because everything has already been thought of, or that every book is the rewriting of a book that has already been written. I try to be honest in the way I work with these source materials and admit freely and immediately what I am elaborating upon. But since these stories are very basic and shared in a certain way, it is the time, manner and matter of the telling that makes one thing unique or different.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: Does it matter whether people are as aware as you are of the sources and references in the film? Does the viewer need to bring the same knowledge to the seeing that you bring to the making?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: It is, and it isn’t necessary for the viewer to be as aware. At a certain point, if you can’t parse the work just by experiencing it and having everyday knowledge of television and film – if it doesn’t work from the level of a person coming at it cold, then it really isn’t successful. If you have to have an exterior text to explain what the work is, then the work isn’t complete in itself. Somebody who does know these historical references can have a more complex understanding of what’s going on, but it’s absolutely not necessary.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: Can you ever look at a film innocently?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: Of course, but no filmmaker is truly innocent. They’ve looked at other films in order to make their own, so they’re never pure to begin with. And being aware of other approaches helps any filmmaker break their habits, especially when they discover their own habits in the work of someone else.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: Is your looking invariably a kind of research?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: I can go to a film just for fun or distraction. But I do have a memory. I never imagined when I watched “The Trial” that I would make a film either based on it or that refers to it. But it was somewhere in the back of my mind so that I was able to make the connection when I needed it. This is how intuition works. An artist’s experience becomes a tool kit, an inventory of techniques, that can be put together in a quick fashion.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: You may start with intuition, but you are quite serious about inquiring into every aspect of what making the film might entail.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: Yes, but a lot of the research turns out to be of no use. I do research to a point where I know enough about a situation that I don’t have to think about it anymore. That’s what the research is for; it’s not to illustrate something you’ve researched directly, but to have an understanding of the flavour of a situation or a moment in time. This is the difference between what Marcel Proust called ‘voluntary’ and ‘involuntary’ memory.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: Is it an inevitable development that your work gets more complicated? If I think of what happens in “Overture” (1986) and compare it to “Inconsolable Memories” (2005) or “Klatsassin”, I realize how much more layered these later projects are becoming.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: They’re certainly more complicated than “Overture”, which was just a matter of taking the Edison Company’s pre-existing film and Proust’s pre-existing novel, chopping them up, duplicating them and then putting them together in a certain order. Now I’m writing the words and making the pictures myself, with the help of a 30- or 40-person crew. Those two pieces are certainly less complicated than a studio film, but I got a taste the kind of work that any independent filmmaker has to do in order to make a feature.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: Do you think of yourself as an independent filmmaker?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: Because I’m self-trained, I’m still a little uncomfortable when I’m around a real filmmaker. Nevertheless something I really enjoy these days is working with actors and learning to work with their skills in maintaining a character over a period of time. A lot of what I asked actors to do before was quite technical but the recent projects have allowed me to develop dramatic situations. It took me a long time to figure out what a director’s responsibility was, but I was able to deduce it from what the cast and crew expected of me. You don’t go too far into the minutiae of your collaborators’ respective crafts, or you will just piss them off, but you have to be either extremely precise or confidently vague about what you want in order to avoid some nasty surprises. Editing is extremely important also, it’s something I like too because it is, in effect, the time when you make the final draft of your script, if there is one.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: You spent the good portion of a year researching and working on a Beckett project, so he’s obviously been a seminal figure for you.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: I was interested in theatre when I was in high school, and particularly in “Waiting for Godot” (1952). I guess teenage angst played a certain role, but then I forgot about Beckett when I went to art school. Towards the end of my studies I found a copy of “Company” (1979) and I realized Beckett was still alive and writing. I thought he wrote “Waiting for Godot” and “Endgame” (1957), then gave up. I was so impressed that I started reading Beckett in reverse order and discovered that his later books were much more successful than the canonical ones.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: So he re-seduced you back into his world?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: Exactly. For example, “Not I” (1972) became my favourite work of art: a voice talks about herself coming into being through language. Language is something she doesn’t really trust, but it is the only thing she has to make herself exist. That’s the fascinating tautology of the work: the writing is suspicious of itself, but it’s the only thing it has to realize itself. The thing I owe to Beckett is an understanding of the impossibility of communication as something a priori but not absolute. The received wisdom is that his work circles around an endgame and collapses into pure interiority, but I think it stages a condition of doubt and suspicion from which communication can begin.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: You seem invariably to start from the interstitial, from the in-between.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: Yes. Working in the form of loops with these recombinant pieces you can’t really talk about beginnings or ends, which are arbitrary and often produced by the ideological or formal requirements of a narrative form. I mean, life is all middle.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: You’re articulating a lack of certainty inside a frame that has a certain degree of certainty about it. Isn’t that an inherent contradiction?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: Sometimes the certainty is false. To instill confidence in the people you’re working with as a director you have to pretend to know what you’re doing, even if you don’t. Sometimes you have to make leaps that allow the process to continue. You also have to allow a space for improvisation. So it’s a matter of creating a space that’s flexible enough that things can go wrong, where you can let other people contribute ideas to make the project more than you expected. If it’s not different and more than you had planned originally, it’s probably not worth doing. It should have probably remained a script. What I end up with is never what I expected and always different from what I intended. When I was developing “Klatsassin”, I was inspired to revisit “Rashomon” after walking through Stanley Park one day and seeing dappled light coming in through the trees. Kurosawa shot the trial scenes in direct sunlight and the contradictory versions of the murder under the cover of trees with only specks of light punctuating the scene. We planned to shoot our murder scenes in a similar way but the weather didn’t cooperate, it was cloudy. This meant that the visual metaphor would change. It was not what I had imagined, but it still works.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: There is an interesting sense of layering in “Klatsassin”; you go to Kurosawa and you end up with a Western set in British Columbia. How did that work?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: Kurosawa was criticized for being too Western. He often took Western narratives and applied them to his films, or people in the West would make Westerns from his Samurai stories.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: There’s a murder that happens outside 11th-century Kyoto in Kurosawa’s film, and there’s a murder in “Klatsassin” as well. How much play do you allow yourself with the narrative you inherit from Kurosawa?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: There was a lot of play. In “Rashomon” you have a bandit, a ronin and his wife; in “Klatsassin” a thief, a deputy and his prisoner. In both cases there is a scene with rain, from which the strangers who meet are seeking shelter, but the ruin of a city gate is very different from a relatively new roadhouse. In “Rashomon” the characters have arrived by chance, in “Klatsassin” they are where they are because of their different reactions to a gold rush.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: It’s a pretty fantastic-looking cast of characters evident in the related photographic portraits you made. They seem more filmic.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: They all have great faces, faces with peculiar kinds of experience, but they were all types. In that historical situation you would meet people and not care to know them well, but you would care about their function. Are they useful to you or will they be a problem? What is their function up here and how will it affect me? I never gave them names: they all go by their profession or function.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: Do you always develop photographic work out of a film, either prior or afterwards? Has that become a necessary part of your practice?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: It’s not necessary, but it’s a parallel thing. It’s often a way of understanding where I am and what I’m looking at. For the recent ‘Western’ series (2006), I followed the Gold Rush Trail up the Fraser Valley to Barkerville in order to understand the landscape. Obviously it’s not the same as it was in the 19th century, but I could at least start to imagine the situations miners were walking through. I visited a spooky ghost town at a place called Quesnelle Forks that I didn’t expect to find. But I must say that my ‘destination’ was a bit of a disappointment, when I discovered that Barkerville had been made into a theme park, with actors walking around in 19th-century clothing, speaking with English accents and doing street theatre.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: It’s interesting that very few people appear in the photographs you made in Cuba in 2004–5. There is evidence of human activity, just not much human presence.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: I consider those photographs to be less about absence than the stage of an action. As soon as you put in a person, it becomes theatre. We try to understand what they are doing there, what they are thinking, instead of viewing it as an architectural space or an environment with some kind of social potential.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: You say you want to avoid theatre, but there’s a lot of theatricality in the film work you’ve been doing.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: It’s very easy for me to do moving pictures of people, but still images I find very difficult because in a moving picture the person exceeds your expectations in some way. They’re always moving, they’re always fleeting; you can’t hold them and say ‘this is what they are, this is what they represent’. When they’re static, it imposes a certainty on their condition with which I have trouble.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: The Cuban photographs for “Inconsolable Memories” (2005) seem to function differently from the ‘Nootka Sound’ photographs (1996), where you’re doing more traditional landscapes.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: The ‘Nootka Sound’ pictures cover an area which to the untrained eye seems like a natural situation. But if you look at it carefully, you realize it’s been logged at least twice. Plus I was looking at different traces of human presence there: either swamps created by the run-off from logging, a fish trap that is 3,000 years old and still in use, a well that was built by the Spanish when they were there in the 18th century or the replica of a longhouse inside a Catholic church that was a gift from the Spanish state, perversely commemorating their conquest of the area.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: So your engagement with a place is always implicated in its political uses?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: In this work I was conscious of doing an anti-Group of Seven piece [A group of Canadian landscape painters from the 1920s]. Instead of being a landscape ready for exploitation because it is supposedly empty, I wanted to show a landscape that was full of people, that was full of human presence, native as well as European.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: So in that sense it’s the same as what you call your ‘re-purposed’ places in Cuba. There is a history of political and economic use in both those places.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: For me it was like a microcosm of the revolution itself. You re-purpose a state or a country when you have a revolution, but you still see what it was prior to that. You can’t completely revolutionize a country. In a way it’s an analogue of what was going on in a larger scale in Cuba.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: You can’t tell from the Cuban photographs whether this is a place that is being rehabilitated or an image that traces the destruction of that place.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: That’s exactly what it’s like. Is this going forward, is it going backward, is it in stasis? A lot of the locations in Cuba are like that.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: Is looking for places like that your reckoning with the failure of Modernism? I guess what I’m thinking is that all places carry a similar sense of failure. The Modernist project wasn’t the only one to put forward that notion, but don’t all Utopias fail? By its very definition, Utopia is ‘no place’.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: Or they don’t last forever. Maybe there was Utopia in Cuba for a little while and it’s not there any more. Maybe it’s working towards a future that it can never realize but that desire is the Utopia. Literacy in Cuba is higher than in the US even now, and there were probably moments in the 1960s when the revolution was functioning very well, in spite of the fact that the US was actively attempting to depose Fidel Castro. Maybe it’s just me, but there had always been something mythical about Cuba. I went to Cuba because I was curious. I’d met a lot of Cuban artists, and I wanted to see what their home was like before it changed, because it will be a very different place once gerontocracy is over.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: So much of your work has been concerned with finding a notion of social justice and freedom inside society. Where did that come from, and why has it seemed so persistent a search in your work?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: It would seem self-evident that these things are important. The social utility of art is that it provides a language to talk about something that is very complicated in a very condensed manner, or to experience something that you thought was familiar in a new way. In my work I am addressing things I don’t initially understand. I try to make a model of transient or mutable conditions in order to understand them. Hopefully, it will have the same use for other people.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: People remark on the complications of your looping. You have a piece that the viewer has to look at for three days before they see all the permutations. Why not make a simpler version of that narrative?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: It’s not a matter of seeing every possible combination, because it really doesn’t change that much after a certain point. Once you’ve seen all the elements, it’s there in your head as a possible construct. It’s just that I’m not forcing a certain narrative sequence that determines its being understood in a particular way – I’m allowing associative possibilities for an audience, depending on when they arrive and when they decide to leave the work. These aren’t linear works, there is no beginning or end, and there’s absolutely no reason to see all the permutations.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: “I’m not Gary” from the ‘Monodramas’ (1991) is a very focused example of how we can thoroughly misunderstand the notion of race: maybe in a benign way, maybe in not so benign a way. How much has your being black played into your work? The question of the Other and its relation to mainstream culture seems so central to much of what you do.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: I grew up black in Vancouver, which in my youth was a mostly white culture with a large Asian and South Asian component, but not so many people of African or Caribbean descent. So I felt quite isolated and was always in that condition of being the Other. There is an outsider figure in all of my works, who is, I suppose, a surrogate for myself. If you want to psychologize – which I don’t. In any event, the situation in “I’m not Gary” actually happened to me. I was walking down the street and some guy said, ‘Hi, Gary, how are you doing’, and he seemed so certain I was Gary that for a second I doubted myself.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: You have resisted the autobiographical as a way of reading your work, haven’t you?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: Yes. Even though I began this interview with a personal anecdote. I just don’t think that works of art should be treated as symptoms of an artist’s biography. It’s bad enough to say that a work of art is a riddle to be solved, what’s worse is to say that the artist’s personality is the key. The suggestion that a work of art is an effect of personality is highly reductive and shuts down interpretation unless, as in the case of Warhol but very few others, persona is your medium. We know very little about Shakespeare, but Shakespeare is still interesting to us.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: Has film been the thing that has interested you the most? Why did you choose that medium as the principal focus of your practice?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: Is that true? I guess it was always ‘film’ in quotation marks. It didn’t begin there; I began with video, and even then I wasn’t a real video artist, I made ‘video’ so I could work with television — and those videos were all shot on 16 mm film. I have used different idioms of representation – silent film, news broadcasting, musical entertainment, television programmes – working within the language and vocabulary of a pre-existing medium.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: The ‘Television Spots’ and the ‘Monodramas’ are absolutely perplexing for a television viewer. They don’t follow through on the delivery of our conditioned expectations for the medium or the message.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: I suspect they’re obsolete by now because we’re used to teaser ads which seem to have no apparent point. When I was first invited to do “Hors-champs” (1992) at the Centre Pompidou, I think I was invited to make French Television spots. But when I finally saw French television, I realized they wouldn’t work at all because the look of their TV was already heterogeneous. The strict genre rules of advertising and broadcasting that we knew in North America didn’t really exist there, and I had to look at something else.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: The two-sided screen in “Hors-champs” allows you to see what’s happening off-screen. Where did the idea come from for structuring the piece in that way?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: Good question. It had to do with the Hors-champs – the out-of-field, the thing you cannot see. I didn’t know what would happen until it was actually made in space. I just thought of un-opposing things being withheld in a certain way. But having one image surrounded by the halo of an absent image was quite powerful.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: Do you ever set yourself a problem in making a work of art?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: The idea of a work of art being a puzzle that has a solution is not very interesting. Why wouldn’t you simply state the problem and the solution? Why go through the process of making the thing? The ambiguities or, to put it positively, the possibilities of an image that does not have a clear-cut answer allow me to be productive in different and unexpected ways. The thing I always wait for is to be told something about a work of art that I didn’t anticipate.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: A filmmaker like Peter Greenaway sets a problem in his films, or uses a puzzle as a point of departure. Then the film is an elaborate way of inquiring into that puzzle, as if there were a solution to it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: In Greenaway it’s sort of a mannerist Structuralism, where you’re taking these systematic notions and applying them to a narrative form. In my work the systems are there, but they’re not as important. The recombinant ones are typically for maximum distribution of the narrative elements so that they don’t repeat the same sequences too often. In “Win, Place or Show” (1998) I adopted a technique from Serialist composition and from Arnold Schoenberg, where you don’t repeat any note until you’ve played all the notes in the tone row.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: How important are music and sound in what you’re doing?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: Sound has become more and more important. Early on I would run out of money before I got to the sound mix, but now it plays a crucial role. “Suspiria” (2003) is intimately involved with being there while the music was being recorded, and then breaking it down to be reassembled by the computer system.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: The music in “Hors-champs” also carries heavy political associations, in that it’s connected to May 1968, a period when France had no government for three days. This is one of those times when a revolution almost happened, when things could have turned out differently.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: This was in the early 1990s, when Wynton Marsalis was saying that Free Jazz was a mistake, an experiment of youth. In a way the revivalists were saying this period of experimentation didn’t happen, and that they should legitimate jazz by making a new museum of its tradition. When I was in Paris doing research, I met various expatriate American musicians who felt betrayed. They had been intimately involved in the culture, and their music was an emblem for a revolutionary idea. Then, as the people who were involved in 1968 became part of the status quo, they either associated the music with a mistake, or they were reminded of revolutionary ideas they had abandoned. So on the one hand the music was being ignored in a general sense, and on the other it was being ignored in France for a very specific reason.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: We’ve discussed the influence of Beckett, but someone else who seems to have informed your work is Bertolt Brecht. Brecht allows us to engage a work of art by being conscious of what are our choices as viewers. Your work also invites that.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: Sure, although the alienation effect has a pretension to objectivity that I don’t really agree with. Probably more important for me were the writings on music by Theodor W. Adorno, the idea that in music, which we assume to be either the most expressionistic or formal of media, could be found very discrete social residue or indices. And in the very musical structure of the sonata or the symphonic form he could discover social content. What I found interesting were his close readings of Richard Wagner and Ludwig van Beethoven. His critique of jazz is notoriously dubious, probably because he never really heard it, but his sociology of European music is amazing. I came across his work the year after art school. Typically in art school there was an antagonism towards reading in general, so as an antidote I decided to take on some long books, including “Under the Volcano” (1947) by Malcolm Lowry, “The Making of Americans” (1925) by Gertrude Stein, and “Doctor Faustus” (1947) by Thomas Mann, for which Adorno was the musical adviser. I said, ‘Who’s this Adorno guy?’ and that led me to “The Dialectic of Enlightenment” (1944), “In Search of Wagner” (1938/52) and “The Philosophy of Modern Music” (1949).\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: Did you read theory because it was useful?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD It just helped me understand things. As I said before, the function of art is to help me make a model of how the world works, or an aspect of how the world works, in order to understand it better. That’s what a theory is. In the social sciences, or in physics, theory is a proposition, ‘Maybe the world is like this,’ and then pursuing your research according to that idea. In my work I’ve said maybe globalization feels like “Journey into Fear” (2001).\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: You also seem to be attracted to stories that have been told filmically at least twice before. It seems like doubleness appears a lot in the work.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: It’s a bad habit, which I hope I have kicked by now. It was something that occurred a lot early on in my work, things always had this binary structure; in “Hors-champs”, in “Der Sandman” (1995), in “Nu’tka” (1996) in “Win, Place or Show” and in “Journey Into Fear”.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: Did you feel it was a structural limitation in the way you were using it?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: I just felt it was becoming a bad habit. It began because two is the smallest unit with which you can have conflict. But lately I have shied away from the double screens that I was using.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: Does one piece of yours naturally lead you to the next? Is there that kind of causality in the practice? I guess what I’m asking you about is musing, about the source of inspiration.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: I try to start from scratch with each new project, but obviously by now I have a tool kit of techniques I use and ways of working with actors and language and the camera that appear again and again. I try to make them as different as possible from each other.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: But it seems that story is often a point of departure for you…\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: I’ll have to think about that. The stories tend to come from a place rather than from a story itself. It’s not like ‘I have a story, so let’s find a place where I can make that story’; it’s more like, ‘Here is this place – what is its story?’\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: I’m struck every time I come to Vancouver at how distinctive and pervasive a place it is.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: I’ve noticed that people who are born here don’t like to leave. I tend to make works that alternate between something very local and something that is away, so it’s away and at home, away and at home. “Klatsassin” was the home story, but then “Vidéo” was shot in Paris. But Vancouver has been important to me, absolutely.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: What about your role inside what is recognized within the art world as the Vancouver School?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: I wasn’t a really a part of it. Ian Wallace, Jeff Wall, Rodney Graham and Ken Lum were a group of artists who’d met every week at the bar. They’d do projects and exhibit together; they’d discuss and write about each other’s work. They developed a very productive relationship. Even though you had the Western Front being part of the Fluxus network, Ian and Ingrid Baxter as N.E. Thing Company establishing international connections within the museum world, it was those four artists who made Vancouver a go-to place for curators and critics. But it’s easier for critics to talk about the Vancouver School brand than it is to talk about the more complex conditions that really exist here. They really can’t get over the fact that so many good artists have developed in this tiny out-of-the-way place on the edge of North America called Vancouver. The really disappointing thing in this city is the general indifference to its own history and culture. Beautiful buildings get torn down all the time and are replaced by monstrosities that aren’t built to last. This neighbourhood is so unhinged because drug dealers and users have been given no-go zones elsewhere in the city. The neighbourhood has been left to go fallow, but that will change because there is only so much real estate here, with mountains on one side and the ocean on the other.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: Are you optimistic about this area? You’ve built your studio here.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: Yes. I always had studios in this neighbourhood, from a time when my milieu was not so much just artists as it was artists and poets. The formal and informal discussions instigated by the first incarnation of a writers’ collective here called the Kootenay School of Writing, was a fundamental influence on my practice. The level of conversation at art school wasn’t all that satisfying but the series of artist/writers talks sponsored by KSW were great, if only because there was something one didn’t understand about the other’s medium and you had to explain things that you otherwise took for granted.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRE: Are you surprised by the success you’ve had?\r\n<br><br>\r\nSD: Right place at the right time.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFRIEZE, September 2007\r\n',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(162,1,'2015-12-08 20:28:30','2021-05-25 21:16:55',4,'1000 Words',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'1000-words',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Douglas, Stan. “Talks About Klatsassin, 2006.” ArtForum',_binary 'Vancouver-based artist Stan Douglas has reinvented some of the most significant works of cinema, from his elegantly looping six-minute, 16-mm work “Subject to a Film: Marnie,” 1989, which follows closely from Hitchcock’s 1964 original, to “Suspiria”, 2002/2003, a recombinant video mix of elements borrowed from Dario Argento’s gory, Technicolor-drenched 1977 cult classic of the same name, transposed to an eighteenth-century tower in Kassel, Germany, during Documenta 11. Douglas’s latest offering, “Klatsassin”—a high-definition video that will be screen in abridged form at the Vancouver International Film Festival this month before making its full-fledged debut at the Vienna Secession in November—likewise engages and elaborates a well-known work of cinema. Here the artist refashions Akira Kurosawa’s “Rashomon” (1950), a film famous for its multiple, contradictory accounts of a murder in a woods outside eleventh-century Kyoto, as a western set in nineteenth-century British Columbia. Taking the narrative complexity of Kurosawa’s murder mystery to a logical, if perverse, extreme, “Klatsassin” is Douglas’s most ambitious and perhaps most audacious act of appropriations yet. \r\n<br><br>\r\nMore ‘Garden of Forking Paths’ than “Gunsmoke,” “Klatsassin,” with its diverse cast that includes a German miner, a prospector and his partner, a thief, a Scottish constable, an English innkeeper, and a Tsîlhqot’in (Chilcotin) prisoner, transforms “Rashomon” into a branching narrative that weaves digressively through five different time periods and multiple, conflicting stories of a murder. To see all 840 permutations unfold, one would have to watch the gallery-bound installation from more than three days.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn his ongoing exploration of looping structures, which began with “Overture” in 1986, Douglas has persistently transformed the way one might employ film and video to construct elliptical narratives and unexpected temporal models. Yet for all its technical sophistication and labyrinthine complexity, “Klatsassin” exploits a relatively simple binary opposition: a poetic tension between the repetitive precision of cinematic time and the fluidity of subjective experience—most specifically in the imperfection of human memory. Inscribing this tension in the formal operations of his film, Douglas circles around—and beyond—the raw materials of Kurosawa’s classic to produce a historically based, subtly allegorical western without end.\r\n-Michael Ned Holte\r\n<br><br><br>\r\n\r\n1000 Words\r\n<br><br>\r\nSTAN DOUGLAS Talks About “Klatsassin” 2006\r\n<br><br><br>\r\n\r\nI don’t necessarily like westerns as a genre. The idea for “Klatsassin” came from walking in the woods on day, seeing dappled light in the forest, and being reminded of the light in “Rashomon”—during the various recollections of the fight scene. When I saw the film again I realized that the differing versions of the same event were germane to my work. So Kurosawa’s movie became an interesting raw material to work with.\r\n<br><br>\r\nMany of Kurosawa’s films have been made into westerns. “Yojimbo” became, scene by scene, “A Fist Full of Dollars”; “The Seven Samurai” became “The Magnificent Seven”. And even “Rashomon,” I was dismayed to discover, had been remade as a western called “The Outrage”, starring William Shatner, Edward G. Robinson, and Paul Newman as a Mexican bandit. It’s quite awful. So, in a way, I’m making good to Kurosawa by doing a tribute to “Rashomon” properly. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThis is a dub western. We have a set of narrative materials that are repeated and recombined to create new variations, which is what happens in dub music, where multiple versions are derived from a single song. The use of a dub track in “Klatsassin,” by Berlin’s Rhythm &amp; Sound, is an analogue to the overall structure of the piece. It’s also a kind of readymade. A readymade is something that is re-contextualized and means something new in that new context—but you still have an idea of what it was in its original context, so it can be two things at the same time. It can be polyphonic.\r\n<br><br>\r\nMy film is set in the time of a native insurgency that took place in British Columbia in 1864. It was the Tsîlhqot’in nation’s response to a gold rush that had begun midcentury and brought a lot of people from Europe and the United States—and with them, smallpox. This is where Klatsassin, a Tsîlhqot’in chief whose name literally means “we do not know his name,” comes in. With the memory still fresh of an epidemic that took the lives of thousands of natives in the region, many Indians up there didn’t want Europeans crossing their territory. Klatsassin himself led a war party that killed fourteen people in a day. Unable to capture any of the insurgents, the governor sent Klatsassin a gift of tobacco, which the chief interpreted as a peace offering. When he came in to negotiate a treaty to end what he regarded as a war, he was tried for murder, and hanged. Armed escorts transported Chedekki, the only member of the war party left alive, to New Westminster to see if an eyewitness could identify him, but he escaped en route. To this day, no one knows exactly what happened, and that’s where my story begins.\r\n<br><br>\r\nPrincipal photography was done around Vancouver, and we shot second unit in various places up in an area call the Cariboo. It’s a different landscape than one normally sees in westerns. I researched the languages spoken there in the nineteenth century, and I looked at the history of this area—the way people dressed, the way they interacted, where they came from, and so on. In “Klatsassin,” I don’t think any two characters are the same nationality or speak the same language. They’re all from different places, scrambling to get their gold. It reminded me of today—people from the US and Europe trying to get the most valuable thing in the world out of the earth in a place where they’re not really welcome. And there was an insurgency. And a prisoner with a bag over his head.\r\n<br><br>\r\nOften we see in galleries motion pictures that have a beginning and an end—linear films that are made to repeat. I first proposed a looping idea in 1986, in “Overture”, which really is a loop: There’s no beginning and no end. Other looping pieces, like “Subject to a Film Marnie” and “Der Sandmann,” 1995, have a semblance of linear narrative, beginning and end, but mostly it’s all middle. With the recombinant pieces, such as “Journey into Fear and Suspiria,” it’s taken to a new level. These works change over time, and often very long intervals pass before they repeat themselves; they are branching narratives, no longer linear or one-dimensional. It’s a matter of extending the possibilities of temporal form far beyond the ninety-minute, three-act dramatic structure Hollywood loves. \r\n<br><br>\r\nMy most complex recombinant work would be “Suspiria,” which lasts so long it might as well be infinite. It is comedic but also quite complicated and it takes maybe an hour for the viewer to understand what’s going on. In “Klatsassin” the structure is apparent after ten or fifteen minutes, but it takes days for all the permutations to play out. And that makes it virtually impossible for two different viewers to see the same thing the same way—much like the characters in “Rashomon”. \r\n<br><br>							\r\nARTFORUM, October 2006\r\n',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(163,1,'2015-12-08 20:36:38','2020-11-24 01:31:59',1,'Abandon et Splendeur',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'abandon-et-splendeur',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Abandon et Splendeur',_binary '<iframe width=\"854\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GtW2hAxaFHY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>',NULL),(164,1,'2015-12-08 20:37:18','2020-11-24 01:31:59',2,'The Power Plant Lecture, 2011',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'the-power-plant-lecture-2011',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'The Power Plant Lecture, 2011',_binary '<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/95919271\" width=\"500\" height=\"280\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen>',NULL),(165,1,'2015-12-08 20:38:12','2020-11-24 01:31:59',3,'Conversationâ€”hausderkunst',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'conversationa-hausderkunst',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Conversation—hausderkunst',_binary '<iframe width=\"854\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1MgKL_G0yPA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>',NULL),(166,1,'2015-12-08 20:39:14','2020-11-24 01:31:59',4,'\"Television Spots and Melodramas\" 1987â€“1991',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'television-spots-and-melodramas-1987a-1991',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '\"Television Spots and Melodramas\" 1987–1991',_binary '<iframe width=\"854\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/R8e4tJo183E\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>',NULL),(167,1,'2015-12-08 20:39:58','2020-11-24 01:31:59',5,'Details for \"Inconsolable Memories\"',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'details-for-inconsolable-memories',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Details for \"Inconsolable Memories\"',_binary '<iframe width=\"854\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KFpX7WuNvb4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>',NULL),(168,1,'2015-12-08 20:40:56','2020-11-24 01:31:59',6,'\"Luanda Kinshasa\" Film Clip',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'luanda-kinshasa-film-clip',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '\"Luanda Kinshasa\" Film Clip','',NULL),(169,1,'2015-12-08 20:42:01','2020-11-24 01:31:59',6,'\"Luanda Kinshasa\" Film Clip',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'luanda-kinshasa-film-clip',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '\"Luanda Kinshasa\" Film Clip',_binary '<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/94233892\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen>',NULL),(170,1,'2015-12-08 21:19:04','2020-11-24 01:31:59',1,'Artist Project Season Works',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'artist-project-season-works',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Artist Project Season Works','',NULL),(171,1,'2015-12-08 21:19:31','2020-11-24 01:31:59',2,'Reference Works ',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'reference-works',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Reference Works','',NULL),(172,1,'2015-12-08 21:24:05','2020-11-24 01:31:59',3,'Minor White: 1857 Project',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'minor-white-1857-project',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Minor White: 1857 Project',_binary 'MINOR WHITE: 1857 PROJECT\r\n\r\nMinor White: 1857 Project brings together images by the American Modernist photographer Minor White (1908-1976) held in the collections of the Portland Art Museum and the Oregon Historical Society. Minor White began his career in Oregon between 1937 and 1942 and his employment with the Works Progress Administration (WPA). The WPA was the largest agency and public works project of the New Deal—a federally funded response to the Great Depression. While mainly self-taught, White was hired as a photographer for the Federal Art Project in Oregon—a program created to preserve and document the “unique and often vanishing features of each state.” \r\n\r\nWhen Minor White arrives in Portland in 1937 from Minneapolis, he lives at the YMCA and has a job as a night clerk at the Beverly Hotel. He joins the Oregon Camera Club, a group with traditional views on photography, mainly to access their facilities and learn the technicalities of the medium. In 1939, he is selected by the WPA to document more than two hundred of Portland’s cast iron buildings in an effort to preserve an urbanism that was fast disappearing at the hand of the many modernization projects that were occurring in the city at the time. \r\n\r\nMany of the cast iron buildings that White was assigned to photograph were on Front Street and slated for demolition in order to widen the street, which exists today as SW Naito Parkway. In 1939, White photographs the Hallock & McMillan building (1857), then the second oldest brick building, and now Portland’s oldest commercial structure predating Oregon’s statehood in 1859. In addition to architectural subjects, the majority of the photographs that White submitted to the WPA were of activities along the Willamette River and Portland’s working waterfront—bridges, cranes, docks and piers; railroad yards, lumber mills and grain elevators; ships docked and boats towing log booms abut the growing city, side by side. \r\n\r\nIn 1940, the WPA assigned White to La Grande, Oregon, a remote country town with population 8,000, located near the Idaho border and surrounded by wheat fields and wilderness. In La Grande, White taught photography at the Art Center, documented art classes and cultural events, and wrote art criticism. White produced most of his independent work in eastern Oregon, focusing on the landscape and its wilderness—country where no one had set foot. For Minor White, it was here that he first came to see photography as much an artistic as a social medium. \r\n\r\nThese photographic explorations led to White’s first solo show at the Portland Art Museum in 1941 where 72 of his eastern Oregon photographs were shown. Though White received his draft letter a month after the exhibition opened, his Oregon photographs brought him national attention and four of the photographs from the Portland Art Museum were shown at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in 1942. \r\n\r\nWhite continued to return to Oregon where he taught many classes and workshops, and photographed over the next decades. White is quoted as saying that his time in Oregon is when he discovered everything he wanted to do with photography; the rest of his career was spent refining and exploring those discoveries. \r\n\r\nIn 2014, The J. P. Getty Museum recognized the significance of Minor White’s contribution to photography with a major survey show and catalogue of his work, “Manifestations of the Spirit.” The last time Minor White was shown in Portland was in 1989 in “Minor White: The Eye That Shapes” organized by Princeton University Art Museum which traveled to the Portland Art Museum. More than twenty-five years have now passed since Minor White’s work has been celebrated in Portland. \r\n\r\nZena’s “Minor White: 1857 Project” brings into public view Minor White’s early works in Oregon, most of which have never been seen, and some, not since 1941. \r\n',NULL),(173,1,'2015-12-08 21:25:03','2020-11-24 01:31:59',1,'Images',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'images',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Images','',NULL),(174,1,'2015-12-08 21:25:42','2020-11-24 01:31:59',1,'1857 Project Works',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'1857-project-works',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '1857 Project Works','',NULL),(175,1,'2016-02-14 17:16:56','2020-11-24 01:31:59',NULL,'Recording',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'recording',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Recording',_binary '\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/162129200\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n',NULL),(176,1,'2016-02-14 17:18:31','2020-11-24 01:31:59',NULL,'Recording â€“ Part One',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'recording-a-part-one',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Recording – Part One',_binary 'Recording – Part One',NULL),(177,1,'2016-02-14 17:19:04','2020-11-24 01:31:59',2,'Recording â€“ Part Two',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'recording-a-part-two',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Recording – Part Two',_binary 'Recording – Part Two',NULL),(178,1,'2016-02-14 17:20:31','2020-11-24 01:31:59',NULL,'Recording',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'recording',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Recording',_binary '\r\n\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/161229435\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n',NULL),(179,1,'2016-02-14 18:11:37','2020-11-24 01:31:59',2,'Recordingâ€”The Performance Menu',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'recordinga-the-performance-menu',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Recording—The Performance Menu',_binary 'Recording—The Performance Menu',NULL),(180,1,'2016-03-30 11:52:26','2021-05-26 20:38:17',3,'Argument: Anthony McCall & Andrew Tyndall\'s 1978 Film and Discursive Event',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'argument-anthony-mccall-andrew-tyndall-s-1978-film-and-discursive-event',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Thomas Beard',_binary 'Saturday, February 21, 2015, 12–4pm\r\n<br><br>\r\nLed by Thomas Beard, this event will follow the workshop-style format of early screenings of Argument (84min) in the late 1970s where each screening was followed by a discussion among the members of the audience. \"In this sense, the film would be no more than an element in a larger \'argument\'.”\r\n<br><br>\r\nSCREENING: ARGUMENT: A PROJECT BY ANTHONY MCCALL &amp; ANDREW TYNDALL (1978)\r\n<br><br>\r\nAnthony McCall and Andrew Tyndall’s legendary and provocative essay film ARGUMENT, first screened at the Edinburgh Film Festival in 1978, and it has been almost unseen for the last twenty years. \"Argument\" has been described by its makers as “a film of intervention.” Partially inspired by Godard and Gorin’s \"Letter to Jane,\" it is an essay film built around images of men’s fashion ads from an issue of the New York Times Magazine.

From objects and primary structures to films as a \"primary event,\" Anthony McCall was among those artists who rejected the notion of installing art in museum galleries, declaring that contemporary avant-garde filmmakers had succeeded in doing little more than changing venues from the art house to the actual museum. Four decades later, he is among those artists who push museums to review, re-stage, and re-perform primary events as museum pieces. Some claim that this is a mis-representation and revisionist deformation of a historic period, others, myself included, believe that the question of \"what and where the object is\" is a productive question which is needed today to redefine museum practice. When we think of time-based installations as performative events of \"objects\" and rules, we can push the notion of a museum collection as a \"performative event.\"\r\n<br><br>\r\nRUDOLF FRIELING is Curator of Media Art at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.

Otherness is a non-conformity Akerman lives, as a woman and a Jew. Is it possible to bring out the fact that the Other, for itself, is completely Subject? The extraordinary filmography of the artist, who has always called herself directly into play, brilliantly resolves this issue. Elisabeth Lebovici met the artist to talk about these themes and to reinterpret some of her past and recent works.\r\n\r\n\r\nELISABETH LEBOVICI: If one wants to begin with a loaded introductory statement about Chantal Akerman, one should definitely talk about borders, frontiers, limits, the other side and the side of the Other. These notions are also there in the way you deal with your work, your craft, your profession: are you on the side of experimental filmmaking, or in the history of mainstream narrative cinema? The side of cinema or that of art? Or all of the above? That would be my first question, since you were one of the most prominent filmmakers to “cross over” in the mid-1990s. What do you feel about this crossover towards making art?\r\n\r\nCHANTAL AKERMAN: My history with installation was probably not an accident, though it appeared as if it were: it would never have happened without Kathy Halbreich, then the head of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, who asked me if I would do something in a museum context. That was probably in the early 1990s, when the curator Michael Tarantino had repeatedly observed that my films were a major influence on contemporary artists. You know I didn’t learn about art. I ran away from school when I was 15. I was never really exposed to exhibitions before the early 1970s, the best years to me, when I found myself in a small group of the New York avant-garde, with Babette Mangolte, Jonas Mekas, Michael Snow, Annette Michelson, whom I respect so much...\r\nAnyway, it happened because of Kathy Halbreich. At the time I was doing “Night and Day”. She said she was interested in history, I said I was equally interested in the polyphony of languages. I had been wanting to go towards Eastern Europe for twenty years – and it was just opening up – in order to work with the different Slavic languages, which are distinct but sound quite similar. I wanted to do a work about changes in voices and languages, a project that then developed on its own into a totally different form: while the texture of the soundtrack is very important in “D’Est”, there is not one word in the film. At the beginning I wanted her to produce such a film; I didn’t care about the art thing. In the meantime I found money and did “From the East”. One year later, maybe two, I was told that funds had been raised for an installation, and I began playing around with the film material I had already gathered. It happened when I had three reels of the film, and I was playing with time. I saw four minutes that worked together in these three reels. Why? I don’t know. There were four minutes. And then we found eight times four minutes, 24 screens as in 24 images per second; that is how the installation found its own agency. I wrote the last, 25th part as something more visually abstract, but with a very intimate text that evoked something more like a memorial. It also deals with limits, death, the camps. My fixation with borders comes from the camps. When you touch on that limit – and I touched it very closely through my mother, who was in the camps but was never able to talk through her anxiety – this border takes on the source of the anxiety, it becomes an “anxious Abject”. In “From the Other Side”, for instance, I show the wall to my mother and ask her what it brings to mind, and she says: “you know what”. When it is internalized, experience is given without speaking, transmitted as a spectral presence; you cannot separate yourself from it. In the film “Down There” the notion of the ‘Other’ takes on more complexity, because it’s the same side, but the other side, the inside too. I try to connect to that internalization, because it’s something you have to live with, that lives there before you. But it’s hard. The reason is that I touched another limit, which is myself. \r\n\r\nEL: Talking about borders and confinement, home and breaking loose... Isn’t that what home is about? When one looks at Jeanne Dielman in her kitchen, or when one finds oneself immersed in your last installation, shot in and from your home, the camera is the operator to feel confinement, beyond the visual depiction of space...\r\n\r\nCA: The jail is very, very present in all of my work, in “”La Captive as well as “Jeanne Dielman”... sometimes not so frontally. Now when you enter America, you have to put all of your fingers in ink, it’s like entering a big jail. Do you know that you cannot smoke anymore in Central Park? New York is not like it was in the 1970s, everything was happening then, now it’s much more about money. France is terrible, you feel no energy at all. In America you still have energy, but mostly for bling. \r\n\r\nEL: For you, where does this notion of the other side come from?\r\n\r\nCA: From Emmanuel Lévinas. He is part of my culture. For two years I attended his classes at ENIO (École Normale Israelite Orientale): he would always have a young person, a boy or a girl, read an excerpt from the Bible, standing in front of him, a minuscule, fragile figure surrounded by tons of books, and then he would get started and go far, far away... I often quote his statement: “When you see the face of the Other, you already hear the words ‘Thou shalt not kill’”. If only he had been heard. How could I not hear it! The other face is also the face of the viewer, I have always thought: I have an understanding that making films is very much about frontality, about facing off.\r\n\r\nEL: The notion of the Other has also been reassessed by feminism, first by Simone de Beauvoir when she observed that “he is the Subject, he is the Absolute – she is the Other” – that is, the non-subject, the non-person, in short, the mere body. Being on the other side, then, is also being on the side of the Other, reclaiming the self.\r\n\r\nCA: It was such an emancipating time, between 1968 and 1973. I felt free to make “Je, tu, il, elle”, which was then an incredible provocation. I shot the film in one week, and at first I tried to have another woman play my part, a substitute for my own body. \r\nBut I soon realized it had to be me, my body. Just as in “Saute ma ville”, which I now think is my queerest movie. “Saute ma ville”, to me, is the opposite of “Jeanne Dielman”: the story of a girl who talks back to her mother, who explodes the norms confining women to womanly tasks, who breaks everything in kitchen and does everything in a crooked way – and yet, for all that, it is a love story: the film is dedicated. \r\n\r\nEL: I love the way you deal with your own body – defying its sense of gravity as well as its respectability – in “Je, tu, il, elle”, for instance, where after your long journey you finally enter “elle”’s apartment, and the first thing you do is to trip on the carpet and fall down...\r\n\r\nCA: I’m a female Charlie Chaplin, I could have made slapstick comedy. I’m thinking more and more about acting again, in my films. My body in a movie is very important, it says something by itself, it has the weight of the Real. I can’t have actresses playing my clumsiness. It seems impossible for me to be in a restaurant without knocking something over: my gestures are too large, or I’m pursuing my thoughts and get startled. You’re out of convention with your own body, with your own way of moving. When I was a child, and being raised in such a conventional bourgeois high school, I thought it was a question of class, I attributed my non-conformity to the fact that I was a Jew. I didn’t attribute it to gender then, but I realized later that the other girls were already built to fit what a young woman was raised to become, in conformity with their future as women in a normative society: my parents didn’t have the time, they didn’t succeed. When I was fifteen and ate too much chocolate, and put on weight, my father suddenly realized that I had to get skinnier to be sold to a man; he wanted me to wear dresses but it didn’t work. When I was 18 I rushed to Paris, then I rushed to New York, to get even farther away. The only person I didn’t succeed in making that split with was my mother, because she was a camp survivor, and I was born when she was older, in 1950. I still think of myself as an old child...\r\n\r\nEL: On the other side of gender difference?\r\n\r\nCA: Well, for several months I joined the feminist faction of “Psych et Po”, with Antoinette Fouque, which made it normal to expose yourself. But that’s another story...\r\n\r\nEL: But you were recruited to film a case history of Freud: was it Anna O?\r\n\r\nCA: No, it was “The Psychogenesis of a Case of Homosexuality in a Woman”. I was just asked to help, not to do the film myself, and was soon pulled away.\r\n\r\nEL: Psychoanalysis is part of your life, but could you film Freud?\r\n\r\nCA: I remember that Dora was fascinating. But there are so many people who have thought about psychoanalysis after Freud. For instance, there is this theory of André Green, in “Narcissisme de Vie, Narcissisme de Mort” (1983), about the complex of the dead mother, where he writes about the ways maternal depression abandons the child and his or her craving for being held, comforted, accompanied. \r\n\r\nEL: Taking sides with the mother?\r\n\r\nCA: At the beginning I thought that since she didn’t have any voice, I would be speaking for her, but it turned out not to be so true, it was just my way of explaining things. What is true is that I was speaking for all women: “Jeanne Dielman, 23, Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles”: what woman didn’t feel something about that? When “Je, tu, il, elle” was released my telephone was bombarded with calls from people who identified with what I was showing. When a figure appears that has rarely been exposed, it indicates that something was probably boiling.\r\n\r\nEL: I have always been struck by the fact that in “Je, tu, il, elle” the performance of sex is there without its reality, as in the scene between two naked women. Not only do you deconstruct heteronormative sex, but in many of your films you also contradict the notion of sexual pleasure as a climax for the psyche. This very much goes with Leo Bersani’s notion of the “Freudian Body”, which disengages the equation between release of sexual energy and jouissance.\r\n\r\nCA: In “Jeanne Dielman” I showed that not having pleasure was her last freedom. If Jeanne had found pleasure in having sex with her client, she would have been surrendering to the men with whom she was working. I had endless discussions with Delphine Seyrig, who said that once you had pleasure, you would want to repeat it... I was only 24 and she was over forty, she was “the subject supposed to know” (Lacan), but I struggled to make her believe me: fighting against pleasure is Jeanne’s resistance, it is her way of existing, her jouissance in relation to the obligation of pleasure, which was the doxa at the time I shot the film. From the 1970s on another obligation had come for women, taking the place of choice and freedom. In “Les rendez-vous d’Anna”, when the main character (played by Aurore Clément) is in Germany, she tells the guy she’s not in love with him, that he has to put his clothes back on. Again, this is resistance to such pleasure obligation. \r\n\r\nEL: Your body returns in the installation “Maniac Summer”, 2009, which I saw at Marian Goodman in Paris (2010); but not as a prevalent image, not as the center. It is night, and a ghostly image appears on just one of the three screens of the installation, doing things, office work, at the computer, on the phone. Then, on the two other screens placed on two other walls, we see a park with children, and a courtyard viewed from a Parisian apartment...\r\n\r\nCA: I did this first part at random, just putting the camera beside me and forgetting about it, doing whatever I was doing. Then I moved the camera to my window, shot a little bit outside, organizing a landscape that was almost unrecognizable. It was more of an orphan film, without subject, object, author... “Maniac Summer” is very much about the other side of the figure, about abstraction. I had heard someone talking about Hiroshima, and it had made a great impression. The intense radiation of the blast left afterimages on walls, shadows of the bodies of people who were standing there, in the instant before they fell. I found the idea of these traces of death very moving, and tried to go forward with that idea in video, which was complicated as a medium for this kind of transformation: when the image falls, what stays on the walls afterwards? It falls into abstraction. Hiroshima is the landmark for the second half of the 20th century. I was born in 1950, this is my time. There are still things to be done about that century. As for the new century, I think we still don’t understand what is going on, at least for the moment. Did you read Jean-Claude Milner’s “Les penchants criminels de l’Europe démocratique”? It’s an extraordinary book, using the texts of Benjamin and Gershom Sholem, and trying to demonstrate how for Modern Europe the name “Jew” was thought of as a problem to solve. Milner explains that beyond all discourse, Europe would not have constructed its unification without the death of the Jews, without the extermination camps. \r\n\r\nEL: Your present, however, is the 21st century: you are doing a retrospective at MuHKA, in Antwerp, and then there is “La folie Almayer”, your latest feature film, based on a novel by Joseph Conrad.\r\n\r\nCA: Not exactly. There is one chapter at the end of the novel that broke my heart, when the girl, the female protagonist, is running away. I read that chapter, and that same night I saw “Tabu” by Murnau and it clicked, you see. That’s why I decided to do the film, thanks to one chapter of “Almayer’s Folly” and “Tabu”, because of the simplicity of that film, where Murnau was able to say such emotional things with almost nothing. My film is about the relationship of a father and his daughter. The father goes mad because he loses her. He is a very weak character, and I saw that as a challenge. My cousin in Toronto told me that in America they would never accept a weak man as the main character, so in a way it is also about gender definitions. \r\n\r\nEL: You live in New York, you have a job at CUNY. What are you teaching?\r\n\r\nCA: I’m not teaching, I’m helping graduate students with their thesis projects, which consist in making films. I push them to improve their scripts, to improve their work with actors and sets, so in a way I’m like a good producer, one who interferes a lot. I enjoy doing it and I’m very moved when suddenly some kind of clarity emerges. But there’s a lot of ignorance of cinema. When I ask “did you see All About Eve?”, many of the students have no idea who Mankiewicz was. One of the students wanted to make a film about a band, which is an iconic theme in America, so I told him he had to see “The Chronicle of Anna Magdalena Bach” by Straub-Huillet, which would show him how to shoot a band. That’s what I’m fighting against. Did you know that the school where I’m teaching is the one that gave Hannah Arendt a position after she fled from Europe? When Arendt came to America, there was a quota at Harvard regarding the number of Jews who could attend the university or be part of its faculty. Such quotas were abolished only in the 1960s. So all the Jews went to CUNY and donated money there, as well. That’s how I got the job. I always end up talking about what happened when the Jews fled from Egypt: it took them forty years – or three generations, in those days – to forget all the signs of slavery. Forty years, the space for oblivion, in order to be released from that bondage and to enter Israel. That’s why I think Pessah, or Exodus, is one of the most important books about slavery. Many countries in Africa didn’t get that time of forgetting, and the people who came out of the camps in Europe didn’t have such time either. If I put myself into a kind of prisoner situation, it is because my mother gave that to me. She didn’t have the forty years, either. That’s why the Genesis is the most important book in the world: because of the Exodus, because of idolatry, too. For me the crucial issues are: no idolatry and losing everything that made you a slave.\r\n\r\nEL: What is your next project?\r\n\r\nCA: I have a gap in my hearing ability. High notes are getting a bit imprecise. I would like to make a film that describes all the effects of this. High pitches are the ones that help us to precisely locate sound sources. I would like to write about it. Blindness is very romantic, it already has its place in literature, in the great myths, first and foremost that of Oedipus, of course. This is not true of deafness. I would like to underline the effects of this impairment.\r\n\r\nMOUSSE MAGAZINE, Issue #31, November, 2011',NULL),(192,1,'2016-05-24 14:18:23','2020-11-24 01:31:59',2,'These Shoes Are Made for Walking',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'these-shoes-are-made-for-walking',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'These Shoes Are Made for Walking',_binary 'THESE SHOES ARE MADE FOR WALKING\r\n\r\nBÉRENICE REYNAUD\r\n\r\n\r\nTap-tap-tap... Preceded by the clicking of her high heels, a young woman (Sylvie Testud) walks through the Place Vendôme in Paris, the camera following her in one unbroken shot until she reaches her car. A young man (Stanislas Mehrar) follows her, gets into his own car, and continues tailing her.\r\n\r\nIn Marcel Proust\'s “À la Recherche du temps perdu” the young woman was Albertine and the man was Marcel. For “La Captive” (1999), her latest narrative feature to-date, Chantal Akerman, adapting “À la Recherche\'s” fifth volume, calls her Ariane. While much has been written about Proust\'s driver/companion Albert, who might be hidden behind the oddly feminine name of Albertine, Ariane is a name without masculine equivalent: in Greek mythology she was the daughter of Minos and Pasiphae who fell in love with Theseus and gave him a magic ball of twine to find his way in the labyrinth.(1) In ARiANE, one finds five letters of AkERmAN. From Proust to Albert to Albertine to, finally, Ariane and Akerman, there is a vertiginous interplay of sliding equivalences, of masks that simultaneously frame, hide and reveal some secret. In the film Ariane\'s partner, lover, captor and tormentor is named Simon, preserving the narrator\'s Jewishness, as well as alluding to Albertine\'s family name: Simonet.\r\n\r\nIn “La Captive”, updated to contemporary times, Simon lives a comfortable existence of ‘homme de lettres’ in a large bourgeois apartment that he shares with his grandmother and a housekeeper, Françoise,(2) and in which he keeps a young woman of unclear social status. Plagued by allergies and asthma, Simon is unable to accompany Ariane when she goes out, however, suspecting her of loving women, spies on her and relentlessly questions her to find out if she is \'lying\' to him. What unsettles him, ultimately, is the enigma of femininity. What is a woman? And which mystery is hidden when two women are together? Proust explores the masculine side of this question, probably transposing his own anxieties - what hidden pleasures could his (male) lover find with a woman? Conversely, in most of her films, especially those with a (semi)autobiographic resonance (“Je tu il elle, Les Rendez-vous d\'Anna”, “Portrait d\'une jeune fille de la fin des années 60 à Bruxelles”),(3) Akerman portrays women who desire both men and women, developing, however, a more intimate bond with the latter. For a female director the challenge posed by an adaptation of the Proustian text is that Marcel is constructed as the subject of desire - who acts upon it, obsesses about it, suffers from it - and Albertine is its unfathomable object. While both Sylvie Testud\'s outstanding performance and Akerman\'s peerless direction give Ariane a complex subjectivity and agency, what she does off-screen and what she thinks remain a mystery. Is it because the effects of female authorship are not powerful enough to dispel the \'active/passive heterosexual division of labour\' uncovered at the core of film narrative by Laura Mulvey: \'woman as image, man as the bearer of the look\'?(4) Or is a more interesting (transgressive) structure at work here: a woman attempting to look at another woman who loves women through the eyes of a man who tortures himself by trying to understand female homosexuality from the inside? Threatened by the contiguity/continuity between two female bodies that the homosexual bond entails, the boundary between two individuals can nevertheless be restored by the introduction of a third term, intervening from the other side of the gender line.\r\n\r\nIn “Portrait d\'une jeune fille de la fin des années 60 à Bruxelles” (1993), Akerman lays this structure bare by turning the main protagonist (the subject of desire) into a rather innocent, albeit passionate, teenage girl, Michèle (Circé), with a hopeless crush on her \'best friend\' at school. As Danielle\'s confidante she is an accomplice, the unwitting witness of the latter\'s awkward search for a \'dream man\'. Michèle escapes her predicament by cutting out of school, meeting Paul, a handsome and sensitive deserter, having sex with him, and then handing him on to Danielle:\r\n\r\n- You\'ll meet him on my behalf. Then you\'ll tell me what happens. No, you won\'t tell me anything. \r\n- You know I always tell you everything. \r\n- Sometimes, I would prefer for you not to tell me everything. Go: he\'s going to be the man of your life ... After that, my mind will be at rest. But you musn\'t tell me anything from now on. I should no longer observe your quest.\r\n\r\nIf not knowing is a torture for Simon, knowing is no less painful for Michèle. Those are the two reverse sides of the same predicament: there is something to know. The beloved woman does not want you the way you want her - she wants somebody else, of another gender. The subject is reduced to being the witness/non-witness of a coupling that keeps being concealed from his/her gaze, like a half-forgotten primal scene in which the forbidden body of the mother was glimpsed as \'belonging\' to someone else.\r\n\r\nTap-tap-tap. Ariane climbs a staircase at the end of a cul-de-sac where she has parked her car. Mesmerised by the sound, Simon follows her on silent, efficient soles. The young woman disappears and Simon is now guided by the clicking of the invisible high heels. In the labyrinth of the city, where every street corner may hide a deception, every grove shelter a forbidden embrace, every smile conceal a treacherous seduction, the tap-tap-tap is the only \'ball of twine\' that the despondent and jealous lover can grasp. It complicates the fort-da game(5) that Simon plays with Ariane, redoubling the original visual dilemma (now you see her, now she\'s gone) into its aural version (now you hear her, now you don\'t). If you don\'t hear her, maybe she\'s behind you, barefoot, or she\'s in bed, asleep and waiting to be ravished with her eyes closed as in a Romantic painting. Yet, if you hear something, maybe it\'s not her but another woman wearing similar high heels (cosi fan tutte)(6) for there are hundreds, thousands of women in heels in the maze of streets, hidden staircases, public parks, hotels, restaurants, theatres and back alleys of Paris. When Simon starts following Ariane, the tap-tap-tap is the sign, both alluring and reassuring, of the young woman\'s presence. As the narration unfolds Simon is increasingly confronted to the multiplicity of high heels. The clicking of heels thus becomes the vertiginous signifier of an overflowing femininity. Julia Kristeva reminds us that, for Proust, Albertine has no fixed identity but always appears as a \'plural\' being, a \'multi-headed goddess\'. \'A woman could not be individuated. A petal in a bunch of flowers, a seagull in a flock of birds, or a mere reflection, detail, indistinct and interchangeable feature. [A] woman/women is always in an undifferentiated plural; she goes in group or bevy...\'.(7)\r\n\r\nOne night Simon is looking for Ariane, who has left earlier wearing a white scarf. Every woman met in the shadows, attracting his attention through the clicking of her heels, seems to be wearing a similar scarf - offering herself to his gaze, or talking to him, or passing unnoticed behind him, or followed by him, half-surprised, half-frightened, in a dark staircase. Unable to fully possess the woman, Simon is reduced to grab pieces of femininity through visual or aural signs that turn out to be lures. Since more than one woman can wear high heels or white scarves, there is no way to distinguish one from the other and the protagonist is constantly mistaking the shadow for the prey.\r\n\r\nA sign of multiple femininity, the clicking of the heels, however, awakens in the subject the dream of a unified signifier. To the child in bed, waiting for his/her mother\'s goodnight kiss, the tap-tap-tap signifies her arrival and then her cruel departure. It is also a bridge between absence and presence. The woman may be unseen but the sound of her footsteps reveals her proximity. She is not, however, motionless but walking - either in your direction (you\'re going to see her, embrace her soon) or away from you, or even passing you by. Here is the paradox: a woman who walks resists ultimate fetishisation for she is in constant motion; yet the shoes she wears are among the most coded objects of male sexual fetishism. One of the many subversions offered by Akerman\'s filmic text is a reformulation of this fetish within the economy of female sexuality. If a fetish signifies a lack, it may not necessarily be, as in the Freudian orthodoxy, the lack of a penis but, more essentially, the lack of a presence. Desired women in Akerman\'s films are often constructed as missing, inaccessible, lost. Signifying the ever-changing, ever-torturing distance between subject and object, the clicking of the heels is an important trope in the construction of her cinematic space. In her universe the shoe might be a fetish, but it is a fetish in motion, always connected to a gesture, an inflexion of the female body: polishing it, putting it on, taking it off, standing, pacing, walking, running, dancing.\r\n\r\nFew filmic oeuvres pay more attention to the musical, emotional and structuring roles footsteps can play in narrative. There are countless instances in which the arrival of the beloved woman is preceded by the sound of her footsteps, in which the tap-tap-tap of high heels function as a permanent echo of a female protagonist\'s mundane activities or hidden emotions. Footsteps also signify the complexity of human interactions in a city, or sometimes, simply, the presence of other human beings. Reaching the bottom of her depression, the heroine (played by Akerman herself) of “Je tu il elle” (1974) stops \'paying attention to the footsteps. They were too numerous, or too loud during the day.\' Later, standing naked in front of her window, she hears \'footsteps, which then stopped. Someone was looking at me. So I remained motionless and naked, so that others passing by might look at me.\'\r\n\r\nThe male shoe fetishist conceives the connection between the feet and the shoes as unproblematic for the woman; she can slip in and out of them in a second and walk in them without being hindered. However, as women know, high heels can be a torture; they are pleasant to look at but not necessarily to walk in. In “Je tu il elle” Akerman wears heavy knitted socks and uninspired clogs. Michèle, her teenage stand-in in “Portrait d\'une jeune fille”, is shown dressed as a tomboy (blue pants, stripped T-shirt, flat black shoes). She explains to Paul that one of the elements of her conflict with her father is that \'I don\'t want to wear chic clothes. It\'s a torture. Especially wearing stockings.\' Stockings, of course, are part of the fetishistic apparatus that involves garter belt and high heels and constrains feet as well as body. Yet, as she continues talking about her \'weird ideas\' about clothing, Michèle inserts the disturbing comment that \'the name embroidered on the school\'s blouse, it\'s like a stigmata\'. No less disturbing is Paul\'s reply: \'A name, it\'s better than a number.\' Unconsciously, the young people know why Michèle\'s father wants her to dress with a certain decorum, and why she rebels against the emotional weight he\'s laying on her. The dress code is to conjure the poorly forgotten memories of the nudity in the camps, the numbers tattooed on the arm, the exhausting marches on bare, bleeding feet, the heaps of women\'s shoes in the storerooms.\r\n\r\nAkerman\'s oeuvre displays an ambivalence between the tropes of forgetting and remembering, as well as about the codes of gender definition. It is my hypothesis that both ambivalences are connected, unfolding, one in a tragic mode, the other in a playful one. As in a Jewish joke, narrative pleasure springs from the intersection of these two registers. Most Holocaust survivors said nothing about their experience to their children in order to \'spare\' them. The task of the next generation was to decipher this silence. Akerman never made a film about the Holocaust - even “Histoires d\'Amérique” (1988)(8) unfolds a playful jocularity - but keeps alluding to it obliquely, thus mimicking the indirect discourse of the Holocaust survivors. Similarly, while her narrative strategies shatter the conventional representation of femininity, she still partakes in and is fascinated by tropes that could be qualified as \'pre-feminist\' - bringing this duplicity of approach to its higher level of complexity and artistic maturity in “La Captive”. Already in “Portrait d\'une jeune fille” this ambivalence was beautifully captured. As she is walking on the street with Paul, whom she has just kissed on a whim, Michèle stops in front of a window that we guess to contain a pair of shoes:\r\n\r\n- Look at those! Don\'t you find them awesome! \r\n- Yes, you\'re right. You want them? \r\n- You don\'t have to buy me a pair of shoes because of a kiss.\r\n\r\nPaul and Michèle are framed in medium close-up, talking to each other while looking in the direction of the window. There is no reverse-angle shot of the famous shoes but, Michèle being a teenager in 1968, we can imagine them as a pair of sophisticated, ultra-feminine high heels. Their conversation drifts toward the nature of Michèle\'s conflicted desires, her \'impossible\' search for \'closeness\', her double attraction for both Paul and \'the one\' she wanted to make suffer. Here we find two of Akerman\'s major tropes. One, at the narrative level, is the woman who loves two people. The other is the refusal to cut and show the object of the protagonist\'s desire. Later, during a party, the camera stays on Michèle\'s face for a long time as she intensely watches Danielle who dances with a young man to the tune of James Brown\'s \'It\'s a Man\'s World\'. At the end of the film, pushed by Michèle in Paul\'s direction, Danielle produces a radiant smile, but the young man is never shown. This cinematic grammar sweetly implies that the pair of shoes is no less an object of desire for Michèle than Danielle is, or later, than Paul is becoming for Danielle.(9)\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nPeople who were once deprived of everything, or whose parents were, are sometimes overcome by a violent, irrational desire for shoes or clothes. The ownership of material goods fills the gap once created by poverty or physical abjection and, on the scale of human emotions, becomes a stand-in for emotional fulfilment. This adds a new perspective to the speech about the \'fickleness of the heart\' that closes “Window Shopping” (1985).(10) In the film\'s last scene, Mr. Schwartz (Charles Denner), the clothes shop owner, attempts to comfort Mado (pop singer Lio) who, still in her wedding dress, has to cope with the fact that Robert won\'t marry her.\r\n\r\n- You see [one dress] in the window you\'ve got to have, but maybe it\'s too \r\nexpensive... Or maybe it looks well on the rack, but not on you. So you \r\nhave to choose another. After all, you can\'t walk around naked!\r\n\r\nThe same thing goes for shoes (and Akerman makes sure that the Schwartzes sell shoes as well, and orchestrates two close-ups of Delphine Seyrig putting a magnificent pair of high heels on a customer, then on a dummy). Like in “La Captive” and “Portrait d\'une jeune fille”, in “Window Shopping” shoes become the substitute for the women who wear them - half-way between the fetish (they trigger desire) and the sign (they signify a presence/absence). A musical comedy, the film starts on a static medium shot of the smooth, glittering floor of a shopping mall, on which seventy-five-odd women, framed from the knee down, pass, either alone or together, walking or running, in all possible directions. Flowing, colourful dresses or straight black skirts, flat shoes, small heels, formal footwear, sophisticated high heels, blue, red, black, yellow and even pink. The shot lasts 2.10 minutes; over a rendition of two songs of the film (\'The Tango of the Shampoo Girls\' and \'At Night\'), the passing of shoes becoming swifter and swifter, the pace accelerating, and we start to notice that the same shoes, the same dresses, are reappearing. In the mall women are not going from A to B but round and round, like laboratory animals. In the course of the diegesis we may recognise some of these shoes - they belong not only to shoppers but to working-class women: the bevy of hairdressers and shampoo girls who work for Lili (Fanny Cottençon), the salon owner, femme fatale and kept mistress of a businessman/gangster. The shoes these young women wear are not only made for walking but for working; they are their uniforms. On the other hand, the first time Lili appears, royally, at 11:30 am, she is seen descending the stairs in a striking red dress, barefoot, a red bag and a pair of red shoes playfully dangling from her left hand. “Window Shopping” interlaces several narrative strands - the most moving being an unexpected reunion between Jeanne Schwartz (Delphine Seyrig) and Eli (John Berry), the American who had taken care of her when she was just out of the camps. The film\'s red thread, however, is the love quadrangle between the Schwartz\'s son, Robert (Nicolas Tronc), Lili, the young hairdresser Mado and Monsieur Jean (Jean-François Balmer), Lili\'s protector. (Characteristically, Akerman adds more angles to the love geometry, for Pascale, Lili\'s best friend, also pines for Robert and at some point Lili makes a spectacular exit on Eli\'s arm.) In a moment of anger at Lili, Robert proposes to Mado. Yet, on the eve of the wedding, Lili makes a no less theatrical comeback. As she hides behind the stage-like red curtain of the dressing room, Robert recognises her by the way she impatiently clicks her fine black high heels. A few moments later, returning to the shop in her wedding gown, Mado sees Robert\'s and Lili\'s shoes involved in some erotic dance in the space between the curtain and the floor and understands that she\'s done for.\r\n\r\nAn even more scattered narration, “Toute une nuit” (1982)(11) follows snippets of the lives of seventy-five anonymous characters during a hot summer night in Brussels. Lovers on the lam, married couples taking a stroll, teenagers eloping, chance erotic meetings, stolen embraces, one-night stands, lovers parting or being reunited, lonely walks through the city, insomniac\'s sleepless moments, a cigarette quietly smoked at a street corner. Some appear only once. We are allowed to follow others, ever so slightly, as their stories develop more fully. A few of these stories stand out, including one that involves the only recognisable star of the lot, Aurore Clément,(12) a woman unhappily caught between the love she feels for one man and the love another man feels for her; she paces her apartment up and down without daring to make a phone call, or runs through the streets to stand below the window of the object of her passion. In another, a housewife packs a suitcase while her husband is asleep, walks away, checks in at a small hotel, and throws herself on the bed, still wearing her white suit and high heels. We see her later, carrying her suitcase on a deserted square at dawn, and then sneaking back home and finally into bed by her snoring husband just in time for the alarm clock to ring and for her to get up. Earlier in the film two strangers, a man and a woman, sit at contiguous tables in a café without looking at each other while the erotic tension mounts. When they get up at the same moment, they violently grab each other.(13) A few shots later they are dancing with a passionate and awkward abandon to the tune from a jukebox. As they slowly retreat in the back of the café the women\'s shoes become visible - a pair of golden high heels, quite improbable for such an occasion.\r\n\r\nRealism is not what governs the subtle choreography of “Toute une nuit”. The film is constructed like a musical, structured by its soundtrack as much as by Akerman\'s lauded visual compositions. The mood is given by a few musical numbers whose source is sometimes diegetic (the jukebox), sometimes not. Gino Lorenzi\'s “L\'Amore Perdonera”, a syrupy Italian love song, is overlaid over two crucial sequences - the faux closure of the Aurore Clément story (she dances with one man while whispering in his ear how much she loves the other one) and the little girl dancing (see below). The soundtrack is a multi-layered symphony populated by the tunes and noises of the city and the ever-present sound of footsteps.\r\n\r\nAll the women in the film, young and old, pretty or plain, wear high heels and can\'t move without being \'betrayed\' by their constant clicking. Akerman plays on this in two different sequences. A woman goes down a flight of stairs, having removed her shoes to escape unnoticed, and joins a man waiting for her outside. Another, in the morning of a one-night stand with a younger man, attempts to sneak out from his house on tiptoes but is caught by her lover and an awkward but sweet exchange of first names follows. Akerman also pays attention to children\'s footwear. In a disturbing sequence, a tomboyish little girl enters a café where a lonely middle-aged man is drinking himself to an alcoholic torpor. The only markers of the child\'s femininity are her little red boots, quickly glanced at (no boy would wear these), and her voice when she invites the man to dance. Accepting, the man is embarrassed, not knowing what to do with his body, his hands reduced to caressing the little girl\'s short black hair as she snuggles up to him. Then, as abruptly as she had entered the place, she leaves.\r\n\r\nThe high heels worn by the shampoo girls, window shoppers and anonymous passers-by in “Toute une nuit” and “Window Shopping” are as artificial and \'theatrical\' as tap-dancing shoes in American musicals and fulfil a similar function: they provide a rhythm, a musical counterpoint to the story. Yet, never losing her sense of irony, Akerman acknowledges they can be a bore to wear as well. One of the \'Jewish jokes\' of Histoires d\'Amérique is passed between two men, but it could uncannily fit (or \'misfit\' as the case may be) women.\r\n\r\n- Oi! My shoes hurt! \r\n- Why are you wearing them? \r\n- I owe money to the butcher, to the baker, to the landlord. I have two \r\ndaughters so ugly, who knows if I\'ll be able to marry them. My son is a real \r\nidiot. And my wife nags, nags, nags. Each time I come back from a fruitless day \r\nof work and look at my bills, look at my family, at that point, I could kill \r\nmyself. So I take off my shoes, and this minute ... it\'s the only thing that \r\nmakes life worth living.\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nThe most famous woman in Akerman\'s cinema, Jeanne Dielman, does not experience the relief of taking her shoes off - except at the very end of the film. A full-time housewife and part-time hooker, she does a lot of walking, even though her wanderings are mostly confined to a restricted space - from her bedroom to the kitchen to the living room, to the grocer\'s, cobbler\'s, post-office, the vendor of notions, the little square, the café where she sits in the afternoon, the entrance where she greets her johns, the bedroom again, the bathroom where she scrubs her body afterwards.(14) It seems important to rescue “Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles” (1975) from being described as a \'realist\' film simply because it explores the semiotics of women\'s daily gestures as nobody had done it before. Instead it alludes to, subverts and reworks the tropes of genre film. As in a horror movie, the spectator is put in a situation of suspense, experiencing a vague feeling of gloom, waiting for the catastrophe to happen, for the \'monster\' to spring out of nowhere and kill. And like a classical musical, it features a glamorous blonde whose clothes, shoes and haunting tap-tap-tap are given centre stage.\r\n\r\nJeanne abides to a strict, abstract dress code. She wears a generic white blouse covered by a blue cardigan, with a black skirt and conservative brown heels. Her colour-coding is unwavering. When working in the kitchen, she puts on a blue housecoat, which she takes off as soon as the doorbell signals the arrival of a john. When she goes out, she has a light-blue coat on. In bed she wears a white nightgown, and when she goes to the kitchen to polish her son\'s shoes and prepare the coffee in the morning she puts on a blue bathrobe, slightly shorter than the nightgown, with a pair of short-heel light-brown slippers. Between breakfast and the moment she says goodbye to her son, she has managed to slip back into her full \'dowdy-but-formal\' attire. Never seen barefoot (as Akerman elides the bedroom scenes, but one), Jeanne is constantly accompanied by the clicking of her shoes or slippers that resonate in the empty apartment for her ears only, or signify, at different moments, femininity-for-sale or loving-but-distant motherhood.\r\n\r\nJeanne is shown as lacking a language of her own (she\'s unable to talk about herself, as her son, Sylvain, keeps entreating her to do with an earnest and boyish insistence that will monstrously develop into Simon\'s feverish questioning of Ariane). It is as if the musical tap-tap-tap of her heels was her only form of aural expression.(15) She clings to it, as a signifier of both her identity and her lost dignity. From the little she reveals, one surmises that this loss occurred before her husband died, before she started turning tricks in the afternoon. What happened to Jeanne and her family during the war? What or who killed her parents, forcing her to live a dull life in her aunts\' house? Why is it that nothing seems to matter, as if everything had been rendered insignificant by an overwhelming catastrophe? One Jeanne echoes another, and one is reminded of Mrs. Schwartz (also played by Seyrig), whose heart was \'dead\' after what she\'d seen in the camps leading her to choose a dull life with a man she didn\'t really love rather than passion with the American soldier.\r\n\r\nAs Jeanne Schwartz says, \'as long as there is food to eat\', or as her husband adds, as long as people buy clothes, things will be okay. For the alternative is too horrible: \'If we don\'t make it through, there\'ll be another horror. And this time none will be spared.\' It is another Jewish joke that \'while Jewish men have the Wailing Wall, Jewish women have their families\'.(16) Families to cry over, indeed, but also to feed, clothes, hold together and manage. While Jeanne\'s ancestors may have walked miles in the Polish or German plains to find food for their children, she matter-of-factly turns tricks to feed her son. This is what a good Jewish mother should be able to do.\r\n\r\nJeanne Dielman is an Ashkenazi Jew; her family and Akerman\'s come from the same parts of Europe - they share the same history, but not the same daily habits. \'When I started working on “D\'Est”\', Akerman recounts, \'I was surprised to see that at home, people were wearing bathrobes and slippers. In my family, in Brussels, we used to change into such clothes as soon as we got home, but nobody else I knew did the same. I found the origin of that custom in Eastern Europe.\'(17) While Jeanne peels potatoes in real time, the way she dresses is not entirely \'realistic\'. And maybe, in our excitement at seeing women\'s work represented so accurately for the first time, we forgot the specific work of the filmic text itself, we jumped to conclusions about the referent (a mistake common to \'misrepresented\' people) instead of focusing on Akerman\'s masterful command of cinematic signs. The real-time filming of some actions - such as similar moments in Jean Eustache\'s “The Mother and the Whore” (1973) - was not meant to have a documentary value but to convey a certain quality of emotion, a certain essential truth about Jeanne\'s inner life and maybe ours. Cinema works through visual and aural means to communicate the invisible and the inaudible. A blue cardigan and a pair of shoes sometimes say more about human life than the Kierkegaard aphorisms that young Michèle earnestly quotes to Paul.\r\n\r\nJeanne\'s formal-wear, especially her shoes and slippers, are the corset that holds her soul together, the dam that prevents abjection and disorder from pouring into her life. For we know all too well who the women are who went barefoot in history - those who lost everything in a pogrom, those who left their suitcases at the entrance of the camp, those who went naked to the gas chambers. And as the other Jeanne (Schwartz) fiercely hopes, \'that won\'t ever happen again. Never again.\'\r\n\r\nYet catastrophes, even minor ones, do happen. A john stays too long, the potatoes burn, my son speaks with a Flemish accent and is slipping away from me, an unexpected orgasm shatters my body, and here I am, trying to repair my composure with this idiot in my bed. In the last ten minutes of the film, Jeanne never puts her shoes back. When she goes around the bed to stab the man, we only hear the sound she makes when she picks up the scissors. Gone is the tap-tap-tap of her heels, the solemn, sad, yet stylish music that had marked the rhythm of the entire film. In the last shot Jeanne sits silently in the living room, waiting. Comparable to moments in “Je tu il elle” or “Toute une nuit” (always at the apex of a crisis), the drone of the traffic and city noises invades the room. The dam has collapsed; real life is entering, yet too late, Jeanne\'s world again.\r\n\r\nFor you can never keep reality completely at bay. The film that most echoes “Jeanne Dielman” is a minimalist documentary (long, uninterrupted sequence shots, no voice-over, no translation), “D\'Est” (1993),(18) shot in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. It is also a film resonant with footsteps. They make a joyous sound when people are crowding the streets wearing stylish footwear to keep on with their busy day, when they go on a family outing, seek the excitement of the night, or go dancing. It becomes more grim when shoes are crushing frozen snow, clicking against icy roads, stepping over freshly fallen snow, wading through slush, or when ageless peasant women, wearing unsightly rubber boots, are picking potatoes in a muddy field. It becomes a sinister sound when emanating from crowds of people waiting in the street, under the snow, at night, in the dead of winter - or in immense waiting rooms - or in noisy train stations. Akerman captures the agony of waiting through relentless tracking shots (some lasting over six or seven minutes). She skips the referent so we don\'t know what these people hope to find at the end of their wait. Food? Ration coupons? Administrative papers? Jobs? The arrival of a train, of a bus? These moments become instances of pure waiting, multiplied into hundreds of conscious minds. Some read books or newspapers, some knit, some carry children, some sleep, some talk or complain, some stare vacantly ahead of them or look at the camera with absent-minded curiosity. Gone are the smart city shoes and dancing shoes. People are wearing no-nonsense clogs, heavy boots, bootees; they stamp their feet to keep warm or express their impatience; they are going nowhere, they have walked far in the cold to arrive here, and now they are stuck. Nothing is more desolate than the noise of immobile footsteps, giving the space of waiting its typical, unmistakably recognisable resonance.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways of waiting - being motionless, pacing up and down, or running because you can\'t stand it anymore. You can wait for love, for the potatoes to cook, or you can wait for the train. And if love comes, or if the train arrives, you don\'t know where it\'s going to take you: maybe to another horror. The originality of Akerman\'s representation of women is that she shows them as active desiring subjects, even when they seem to be repressed or in a position of passivity. Instead of focusing on Jeanne\'s alienation, why not praise the incredible courage and gumption this middle-aged widow is displaying when turning tricks (as difficult a job as any) instead of despairing or turning to welfare? Instead of seeing Ariane as \'acted upon\' by Simon\'s desire, why not see her as a modern woman who, by loving men and women at the same time (not an easy feat), acts upon her own desires? Whether they are waiting, hiding, cooking or running, Akerman always shows women on their feet. Their shoes, indeed, were made for walking.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to Yvonne Rainer who showed me the importance of women\'s high-heel shoes in “Toute une Nuit”, and indirectly inspired this text.\r\n\r\n— Bérenice Reynaud\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n1.

What other filmmaker, for example, would have offered all her resources to her bankrupted producer, as Chantal did for Paolo Branco in 2008? Instinctively – never a matter of doctrine but of living proof – Chantal Akerman lives and acts day-to-day the teaching of Emmanuel Levinas: thinking through the Other. We shall see how this ethics structures a conception of the image. On the one hand, we find iconophobia, that is, the rejection of the idolised image (‘in the Sanhedrin Tractate, it is written: one must not say to another, wait for me by such-and-such idol’ – Maimonides, “Laws Concerning Idolatry”). On the other, figurability: an analytical relationship to the world founded on a deep understanding of the complex interplay of projections comprising human exchange – an interplay that the cinema can legitimately take as its very material.\r\n 	 \r\nIn the heat of the summer of 2011, although busy with the release of her new film, Chantal Akerman offered all the time needed to elaborate on this interview – which she reread and corrected while scattering I don’t know throughout, to reject, with characteristic tenacity and exactitude, any pretense of mastery. I have organised this wealth of material like a small, private encyclopedia, both alphabetically and chronologically, while interweaving commentaries on the films chosen by Chantal for the carte blanche series offered by the Viennale (The Vienna International Film Festival) and screened at the Filmmuseum. The title of the interview is, of course, a homage to the 1957 musical comedy “The Pajama Game” (the “Golden Eighties” of its era), which, Jean-Luc Godard wrote so well, yields to an ‘unrestrained’ joy in freedom, ‘the pleasure and the need to dance’. (1)\r\n\r\n \r\nAKERMAN\r\nNICOLE BRENEZ: A for Akerman, it’s logical. Let’s give this interview a concrete, historical frame: it’s July 2011, you’ve just finished “Almayer’s Folly”, and we’re talking against a backdrop of violent economic crises and revolutions. How are you taking them?\r\n\r\nCHANTAL AKERMAN: I was born in 1950, in a very poor family, but in the context of the post-war era, things were getting better and better, at least in the Western world. Today, it’s hard to imagine what will happen once we’ve suppressed everything that allows people to get by halfway-decently. Or unfortunately, maybe it’s not so hard to imagine.\r\n \r\nNB: Do you think that the next revolution could come from the extreme right in Europe, that the Arab Spring could be suppressed by the fundamentalists?\r\n \r\nCA: Maybe. Maybe, yes, there are days when I tell myself that. I always believe the worst. Unfortunately, history has tended to give me reason. In 1941, the Americans knew that the war was won, and they started to organise the escape of the Nazi heads with the Vatican. In 1972, they appointed a criminal, an old officer in the stormtroopers, to the head of the UN [Kurt Waldheim, Secretary-General from 1972 to 1981]. Power has no soul. You can’t be surprised by anything. Today, the neoliberal lobbies insist that we cut the budgets for education, health, assistance programs for the poorest people – everything that makes the world livable. Two years ago, during the first crisis: I was in Miami, and in the Haitian quarter I saw all the multi-coloured houses closed up and barricaded. I wanted to paint some sheets different colors and write a soundtrack taken from what happened to the people who lived in these houses, and make an installation.\r\n \r\nNB: Why didn’t you do it?\r\n \r\nCA: When things don’t happen right away, I lose my drive. And anyhow, I had to prepare “Almayer”. But I regret not doing it.\r\n \r\nAMOUR FOU\r\nNB: ‘The fall of a European in Malaya. That is what [Joseph] Conrad wanted to write about when he started his first book, “Almayer’s Folly”’. So begins your note on the film’s intentions before shooting.\r\n \r\nCA: Yes, the first note. There have been so many more.\r\n \r\nNB: For me, ultimately, I saw a film centred around primal feelings, a film about l’amour fou, a portrait of a man in terrible love with his daughter. Is it anything like an idealised portrait of your father?\r\n \r\nCA: No, no, certainly not. I don’t think we need to go rifling through my autobiography. It’s imprisoning.\r\n \r\nIt’s the problem of love in general: is it for the other person or one’s self? Almayer is driven by the love he thinks he holds for his daughter; overwhelmed by his calamitous life, he has nothing else. He represents the anxious, depressed side that his daughter won’t share.\r\n \r\nAlmayer and his daughter represent two characters and sides of me: the daughter who dares to leave home, as I did when I was a teenager; and the depressed father, who, like me, is immersed in his own sense of loss. We fall back on autobiography. Better not to. Anyhow, that’s how I explain the film to myself, for the moment, and my desire to make it – but everything is always more complicated. Or much simpler.\r\n \r\nWhen I read Conrad’s book, there was one scene that struck me: the father is going to talk to his daughter, so that she’ll stay with him, so she’ll return. It moved me to the point of tears. I don’t know why or how, but I genuinely believed this feeling. It’s not the colonial who interested me. That same night, I saw Murnau’s “Tabu” (1931). And I felt a sort of spark between this scene and “Tabu”. And it was at that spark that the desire to make this movie came about.\r\n \r\nNB: What exactly does Almayer want for his daughter?\r\n \r\nCA: For his daughter, I don’t know; he needs a reason to live. To exist. What could he give his daughter? Nothing.\r\n \r\nWhen she leaves with a guy she doesn’t love, it’s because anything would be better than staying with her father. It’s her mother who pushes her, her mother’s who’s more practical. Maybe it’s better to get to know someone to be able to love them later on, like it used to be in arranged marriages. Little by little, they can learn to respect each other. Well, sometimes. In the end, I don’t know.\r\n \r\nART MARKET\r\nNB: You entered into the field of cinema on your own, without going through a school or institution or group, and little by little you’ve carved your own path through force of will, without ever compromising. How did you get into the sphere of plastic arts?\r\n \r\nCA: By chance. I’ve never seen myself as an artist. Kathy Halbreich, who was working in a museum, asked me to do something. I set myself to it. It started like that. I enjoyed it, I kept doing it.\r\n \r\nTo make ‘art’ is usually wonderful. The art market is another thing. It’s often tied to power, to the phallus – but not always.\r\n \r\nIn cinema, when you make a film, even for four people, anybody at all can enter the darkened theater; it’s democratic. In the art world, there’s an elitism that reigns sometimes that’s tied to capital. Fortunately, not always. In the Renaissance, the Medicis let Michaelangelo make revolutionary work like ‘The Slaves’. Claude Berri, who, like my father, was a small Jew who came from leather and fur, would get up and say he was looking at his Yves Kleins. They were his. What was he really looking at, the painting or its value? Both, without a doubt; I don’t know. Ultimately, it’s touching.\r\n \r\nMy father also started to buy paintings at the end of his life. Bad paintings, but he liked them. I find it very moving.\r\n \r\nNB: Today the speculators don’t buy the works they like; they put their names on a list and wait to acquire a painting they haven’t seen by an eminent artist.\r\n \r\nCA: Fortunately, they’re not all like that. But it’s true, for example, that the paintings sold at auction fetch astronomical prices.\r\n \r\nAfter the revolution – and it really was one – of Duchamp, a kind of perverse spirit has quietly taken hold and now everything is supposed to be art. When Steve McQueen spits on the ground, he declaims that it’s art. I know, it’s a provocation – but not only that.\r\n \r\nNB: So how do you manage to work in the context of the modern art market?\r\n \r\nCA: It’s turned out that, up to now, I’ve been able to work through intermediaries whom I’ve respected. Not only in public museums, also in private markets. I respect Suzanne Pagé, at one point the director of the Museum of Modern Art, who advises [Bernard] Arnault. There have sometimes been real modern patrons, like Sylvina Boissonnas, the Schlumberger heiress, who sponsored the Zanzibar group and then, unfortunately, the ‘Psychoanalysis and Politics’ Group. Or the De Menils, also from the Schlumberger family who, instead of locking their works up, founded DIA Beacon and transformed an old Nabisco factory not far from New York into an exhibition space.\r\n \r\nBut in the end, art usually serves the rich – the phallus. Occasionally, there are collectors who are really in love with art. Again, nothing’s simple. Before the war, the gallery owners kept the artists alive – not through speculation, but through love for the artists and their works. Even when it’s exhibited, often in palaces, art becomes just the exhibition of a limitless ego. But, all the same, it’s good that it gets shown.\r\n \r\nNB: Jonas Mekas had a line about Mankiewicz’s “Cleopatra” (1963): why all this lavish delirium on-screen instead of just buying a big gold nugget and exhibiting it directly as is?\r\n \r\nCA: Ah, I hadn’t heard that one. The Golden Calf. Idolatry. And before the Golden Calf, slavery, the pyramids. We have to reread Exodus, it remains so true.\r\n \r\nI’m not on-board with Polanski’s “The Pianist” (2002): art doesn’t serve a powerful purpose, it doesn’t reconcile people with each other. And not European art. I sometimes have the impression that German Romanticism led to the war. But maybe it’s just an impression.\r\n \r\nBOOK\r\nNB: Besides your scripts for “Les rendez-vous d’Anna” (Albatros, 1978) or “Un divan à New York” (L’Arche, 1996), you published two books: one play, “Hall de nuit” (“Night Lobby” L’arche, 1992), and a story, “Une famille à Bruxelles” (“A Family in Brussels”, L’Arche, 1998).\r\n \r\nCA: For many reasons, I believe more in books than images. The image is an idol in an idolatrous world. In a book, there’s no idolatry, even if you can idolise the characters. I believe in the book; when you immerse yourself in a huge book, it’s like an event, an extraordinary one.\r\n \r\nNB: What books were events for you?\r\n \r\nCA: It happened more when I was young. These past few years, one event has been Vasily Grossman’s “Life and Fate”, published fifteen years after he died. And Varlam Shalamov’s “The Kolyma Tales.”\r\n \r\nNB: Two Russian stories that document the war and the camps.\r\n \r\nCA: Yes. Always that.\r\n \r\nThere were heroes in the camps. My mother, when she was 15 in the camp, worked nights manufacturing battle supplies for Krupp. A soldier from the Wehrmacht visited the camps and said, ‘it’s not normal for children to be working at night’, and he moved her to the day shift – but everything else, the imprisonment, the exploitation, the death, all this he found normal! My mother and her aunts were taken care of by an older woman who would save them a bit of bread so they could stay alive. During the death march, when the Nazis saw that they were flanked by the Americans and Russians, they emptied the camps and made the prisoners walk barefoot, or with paper to wrap their feet, from one camp to another. My mother doesn’t realise it, but her aunts supported her when she fainted, and they chewed her food for her so she could eat.\r\n \r\nNB: ‘The world is no more, I’ll have to carry you’, wrote Paul Celan.\r\n \r\nCA: They were saved by some French soldiers who were heading in the other direction, when they suddenly heard these women talking in French; they stopped, wrapped them in their overcoats and led them to the Bremen bridge on the American side. They brought them to a hospital and fed them bite by bite, which saved them. So many people died by starting to eat again too fast.\r\n \r\nBRESSON (ROBERT), “MOUCHETTE” (1967)\r\nCA: The ending of the film, with Mouchette rolling toward the river, is tremendous. With so little, Bresson makes us feel so much about the world: Mouchette rolls alongside all those who have ever been sacrificed; all those who haven’t been just raped but destroyed. All those who have been rolled in the mud.\r\n \r\nNB: Mouchette prefers to remain in solidarity with her poacher-rapist and to die rather than stay with the old village dignitaries. She’s in solidarity with her class.\r\n \r\nCA: Yes. I don’t know. Perhaps. I only remember the ending. When I was shooting D’Est in the Ukraine, we ran out of gas. Some peasants siphoned the gas from their car to give it to us, but then didn’t want us to leave and prepared a feast. Poor as they were, they cobbled together what they could to offer us a meal of a king. They didn’t know Prokofiev or Shostakovich, but they knew that when someone’s hungry, they have to eat. Stalin himself ‘forgot’ to plan for the plowings, and caused a famine in the Ukraine that led to the deaths of seven million people. Even though he came from there, the Ukraine. Nothing is simple. Those same peasants could still have massacred the Jews in the war. The same peasants or others.\r\n \r\nNB: What’s so frightening in “Mouchette” is that ferocious desire to die, this assertion of death. Mouchette tries three times before she manages to drown.\r\n 	 \r\nCA: Yes, it’s often like that when one wants to die: keep trying and then it comes. It’s also a film about France, which could be so beautiful and hides a kind of horror. Later, Mouchette is going to be buried, and the land is tied to the killing. It’s why I don’t trust the land. Blanchot wrote a beautiful text on the Jews and nomadism in “The Infinite Conversation”: he affirms nomadism and the book. (2) No land, no killings: Blanchot explains that land equals blood and that the world is nothing more than an enormous cemetery, still bloody, while the book can be a bloodless land. To live without one’s own land is to risk becoming an enormous slaughterhouse. Nomadism is beautiful and it’s heroic. But is it good to be heroic all the time?\r\n\r\nDESIRE\r\nCA: I was living in a maid’s chambers without heat. The winter after ‘68, it was frozen. I was living at 86 or 88, rue Bonaparte, and there was no water. Across from me there lived an old couple, a painter and his wife, in two maid’s chambers where they’d lived their whole lives. I had just a small lamp with me that I put on my belly to keep warm. I went to the student’s residence with my foam mattress that was three centimetres thick. I lived there and met plenty of people, strangers, and they welcomed me. Sometimes I’d put my gear in the hallway. Where I stayed, the ice was thick over the windows; I never lived in luxury, but in Brussels at least our place was warm. My father must have assumed all of his, but he let me go; he obviously knew I’d get by. Paris was the city of dreams, the city of writers, and I wanted to write in Paris in a maid’s chambers. Not in Brussels. My cousin was in Paris, and she paid me a little to take care of her baby daughter. I didn’t take the Métro; I walked. But I still don’t know Paris. It’s all been erased.\r\n \r\nNB: You treat this situation of poverty and freedom in a lot of your films. “Almayer” gives one example, when Nina runs away from boarding school and wanders through the streets, penniless.\r\n \r\nCA: Yes, certainly. You work with your material. That’s all you have.\r\n \r\nLater, I lived on the rue Croulebarbe, in the same building as François and Noëlle Châtelet. With Alex, a young man who was studying Chinese and Laozi, I’d go to Vincennes to listen to Deleuze and Lacan. Lacan was really sarcastic, especially with the girls; he’d take up their questions to mock and ridicule them. He was already into his Borromean knots, and nobody understood any of it. Deleuze, I only saw him one time, I don’t remember it well but I remember the atmosphere: lively, impassioned, fun. I met Alex when I was 13, through DROR, the Zionist-Socialist Jewish movement. Alex had a small allowance to live on, and he came to live with me. He had a tiny hotplate, and I’d buy whatever was cheapest, carrots and rice – it got monotonous. There were showers and some underfloor heating that nobody liked. Alex wanted to take me hitchhiking in Japan, but I left him. He was handsome, despite his acne. He committed suicide, and I learned about it while I was waiting in line to see a film. He also wanted to be Rimbaud. He talked very little about himself.\r\n \r\nNB: In your maid’s chambers, what did you write?\r\n \r\nCA: I wrote “je tu il elle”, but as a novel, not a film. It was only years later [1974] that I made the film. I hitchhiked back to Brussels to see the girl, Claire, who’s in the film, and I had all sorts of adventures with the truck drivers who picked me up. It was dangerous. But that’s how we lived at the time. I also helped my cousin Jonathan to write a play about Van Gogh, and I read Vincent’s letters to his brother Theo. And then I cracked. I cut my hair close-cropped, I went back; my father was shocked, it was obviously an act of self-mutilation.\r\n \r\nDIRECTING THE ACTOR\r\nNB: Do you recount these episodes of your life to your actors, so they understand the stakes of what they’re playing?\r\n \r\nCA: No. I don’t tell them any of that. And when I make a film, I don’t think about any of it. And the film isn’t even tied to it. Here I’m talking, I’m letting myself go. I’m talking because I think it’s what you want to hear. But a film is something else. I don’t say anything much to the actors. I just try to make the right choice. That’s all.\r\n \r\nFor “Almayer”, we didn’t rehearse, I didn’t give instructions; I gave them a space and they went for it. When they moved, we’d follow them, like in a documentary. They were each free to do as they pleased, or almost.\r\n \r\nRémon Fremont is a great documentary cameraman; it was with him that I shot “Sud”, “D’est”, “De l’autre côté”, and a narrative, “Portrait of a Young Girl in Brussels at the End of the ‘60s”. At the end of shooting, he cried in my arms; he told me he’d never been so happy. Everybody was really happy; everyone felt like they had their own room to breathe and, at the same time, they felt in harmony together. Stanislas Merhar especially, he understood the path we’d taken, but I hardly told him anything: just some suggestions, sometimes in the most discreet ways. While playing, Stanislas would talk about himself, I think, about his own relationship to life – or non-life: I could tell what he was doing and I accepted it. When we first met, for “La Captive”, he didn’t say a word to the crew during shooting, except to me and Sylvie [Testud]. Everyone thought he was haughty but, no, he was just a little ‘autistic’. He came on-stage and could only see his work. We have a very strong relationship, which nothing could ever undo; we each have total trust in each other. The kind of mutual respect we’ve attained makes everything peaceful between us; it will never be betrayed. As is often the case in cinema.\r\n \r\nNB: Even for the last shot, which is so virtuosic and intricate, you didn’t plan anything?\r\n \r\nCA: Absolutely not. There was no need. We kept Stanislas’ chair moving toward the sun, very slowly. He talked, he kept quiet, he listened to the sound of the river, he looked at me, I told him to keep going; the scene lasted 10 minutes and I selected a fragment from it.\r\n \r\nENERGY\r\nNB: You’ve shown unparalleled energy. You salvaged Almayer from a black hole of extraordinary production problems, like a lot of your work.\r\n \r\nCA: My energy comes in fits. I spend half my time in bed. Luckily there’s a window now in front of me, and I look outside. Before, there was a wall. I had my first manic episode at 34. My life changed, something broke down: something of that energy that filled me when I was younger.\r\n \r\nNB: What was the nature of this change?\r\n \r\nCA: Previously, I had felt a kind of energy in life, with moments of depression of course – but I read constantly, took notes, was curious about everything. Then it was gone … The breakdown knocked me out. Before, I walked barefoot in the street, I brought poor people home, I wanted to save the world. Imagine, I telephoned Amnesty International to try to get them to dig a hole to the other side of the earth, to Siberia, so they’d get out all the people imprisoned in the camps! I wanted them to have 10,000 Socialist Jews brought to Israel to change the government and make peace … But I wasn’t living there, and it’s for the Israelis to know what’s to be done. Not for us who live here, for the time being, securely.\r\n \r\nI want the days to end early. I go to bed at 5pm, at 8pm, with sleeping pills. Without complaining. That’s how it is. I cope with my illness. It’s an illness like any other.\r\n \r\nNB: So what fuels you? How would you describe yourself?\r\n \r\nCA: How would I describe myself? My first response would be, ‘I’m a Jewish girl’. But if you asked me, ‘what does it mean to be Jewish?’ I wouldn’t be able to tell you. I had to leave the Jewish community to get by, and sometimes I miss it. When I see orthodox Jews walking in my neighborhood – leaving the synagogue, with their black hats – I tell them, ‘Shabbat, Shalom’, and it does me some good. It’s stupid, I know, but that’s how it is. They look at me weirdly but they respond, in a low voice, ‘Shabbat, Shalom’. At that moment, I feel like I belong – or the opposite, that I’m looking to belong, even for just a second. It’s a funny thing – besides which, I love Israel, even if it’s its own form of exile. One more type. I feel good there, usually, even if I don’t agree with the government. Even if I know that, for Israel to exist, it has to act like other races. To shed blood, and seize lands.\r\n \r\nWhen you’re with Jews, even if you hate them, there’s something already present, something unspoken there. (Except with self-hating Jews). There can’t be any anti-Semitism.\r\n \r\nStill, it was a Jew who denounced my mother. He was a doorman at a nightclub. He’d hidden my family to get money from them and, when the money ran out, he denounced them. He was taken down by the Resistance; he was an Untermensch. Nothing is simple, and whenever I say anything, I want to say the opposite as well.\r\n \r\nNB: You don’t hesitate reusing a Nazi term?\r\n \r\nCA: No. Not for this man. Maybe I should leave their vocabulary to themselves, but it has left its marks.\r\n \r\nMy father never wore the yellow star. His sisters hid him in a convent, and the nuns tried to convert him. The Jews don’t have the right to proselytise, unlike the Catholics and Muslims. My grandparents were so naïve; they couldn’t imagine what was going to happen to them, and thought they were being taken off to work. My grandmother’s paintings were stolen.\r\n \r\nFILMOGRAPHY (ANNOTATED BY THE FILMMAKER)\r\n“Saute ma ville (Blow Up My Town)” 1968\r\nThe opposite of Jeanne Dielman.

Philippe is only two years older than you, and you have a lot of the same reference points, Rimbaud, Godard, and the same minimalist, anarchist tendencies …\r\n \r\nCA: I don’t know if we have the same references. Young men dream of Rimbaud, not young girls. Anarchist? I don’t see myself in that word. I was there, of course, and I wanted to make films, in ‘68. Yes, Godard, of course, minimalist. I remember when Philippe came to the house to film “Elle a passé” … . I hadn’t slept the night before. He had an old camera, nearly broken. He had to secure the lens with his hand.\r\n \r\nNB: That’s why that film is so stunning.\r\n \r\nCA: Maybe.\r\n \r\nGIRL\r\nNB: You always talk about yourself in terms of a fille, girl, daughter; one of your self-portraits is titled “Portrait of a Young Girl in Brussels at the End of the ‘60s”, and the main female character in “Almayer’s Folly” is named Nina, petite fille or little girl. Fille signifies youth but most of all a filiation, a heritage. For you does fille mean not to be a femme, a woman?\r\n \r\nCA: Possibly. Probably. I don’t know. I never grew up. I was always an overgrown child. Almayer is a father who has a dream for his daughter and maybe for himself in regards to her. I never followed my father’s dream, to have a family. I stayed a girl, the daughter of my mother. In the end, I don’t know.\r\n \r\nMy sister, yes: she started a family in Mexico. She has two beautiful, intelligent children. My niece is getting married soon and the line will continue. Sometimes I regret not having kids. Maybe I would have gone from a daughter to a woman – but whether that was possible for me, I don’t know. Probably not.\r\n \r\nNB: So you determined to remain the girl.\r\n \r\nCA: I wouldn’t say determined. But it’s what happened. I was the first child. My mother always scolded me for not eating, she obsessed over food. At three months old, I was sent to board in Switzerland, to eat porridge, always the same porridge, and they knocked my chin against the sink if I didn’t eat it. Things got better when my sister was born. As a teenager, I ate voraciously – which bothered my father, since you had to keep skinny to get married. He was a Jewish father, nine years older than my mother, with three sisters he also took care of, and my grandfather who lived with us. To show us what we should or shouldn’t do, he banged the palm of his hand on the table top.\r\n \r\nNB: Something you often do yourself.\r\n \r\nCA: Yes, probably. In the ‘50s, parents claimed their own authority; they didn’t want to be friends with their kids.\r\n \r\nNB: They were the trustees and guarantors of a law. What values did your parents want to impart?\r\n \r\nCA: Yes, the Fathers, in any case. You had to be a good human being. To act properly: there was what one did and what one didn’t do, and in the end it was that simple, even when you didn’t agree.\r\n \r\nBut, on the other hand, they didn’t encourage me to work at all. My father didn’t pay any attention to school, and for months I didn’t go. My mother signed my report card half-asleep on her bed. They never pushed me to study, even though I was quite good at school. But afterwards, high school was a disaster. Because I was a good student, they sent me to a very wealthy, rigorous high school for the intellectual elite, Belgian Freemason types. I met daughters of doctors, academics and captains of industry. I was an outcast.\r\n \r\nMy father became a worker when he was 12. On my father’s side, I come from a family that’s tumbled down the social ladder. My family in Poland was rich, and my grandmother was accustomed to a grand lifestyle. Her three daughters learned to play piano. But then they fled Poland with nothing and my father became a worker, a glove-maker, to feed his family.\r\n \r\nHe would have liked a son in my place, so his name would have been carried on. One day I asked him: ‘Have you seen what I’ve done with your name?’ He’d read a few articles on me, but it wasn’t enough; in any case I wouldn’t perpetuate his name, so disappointment was predetermined.\r\n \r\nNB: What was your mother’s name?\r\n \r\nCA: Leibel.\r\n \r\nNB: Almost an anagram of ‘Liebe’, German for ‘love’. [In Yiddish, Leibel signifies ‘little lion’].\r\n \r\nCA: In her family, the most important person was her mother. Her father was a cantor in the synagogue and their marriage, of course, was arranged. My grandmother was already a feminist; she wanted to become a painter and get married on her own. She was born in 1905, and her mother was very religious. She didn’t get the life she wanted – no more than my mother, who admitted as much the day after my father died. With a kind of fury. This time, I was the one who couldn’t understand. Am I the repository of all that? Doubtless – all that, and other stuff, too.\r\n \r\nNB: If you go back to your life, your freedom, your creativity – don’t you have the feeling of a kind of reparation?\r\n \r\nCA: No, definitely not. What reparation? At first, I thought I was speaking out, since my mother never had been able to – but now I know that’s not it. That I never had a choice. Not really. Well, I don’t know.\r\n \r\nI lack that kind of drive to be constantly turning my thoughts into actions … But everything comes from the journal of my grandmother. When I got sick for the first time, my mother fled, but left me the diary of her mother, who came from a very orthodox family. In 1919, at 15, she was writing: ‘It’s only in you, dear diary, that I can confide my feelings and my grief, since I’m a woman!’ She would paint in secret on Saturdays. My mother thinks I’m her heir, that it all comes from her. My grandmother made dresses and drew the models herself. My mother’s dream, before the war, was to learn to draw so she could open a fashion house with her mother. But that dream died in the camps along with so many others, and nothing more was possible.\r\n                                                  \r\nWhen I wanted to make movies, my father didn’t want it. He was scared I’d be overwhelmed, that it would go badly. But my mother said, ‘let her’.\r\n \r\nThe diary was the only thing that was left of her mother. I’ve read it a dozen times. My mother wrote a couple lines in it, I did too, then my little sister as well. A whole female tradition. Thanks to it, my mother never believed that men were superior. Of course, she served my father, she gave him the best pieces at dinner … but not in her head. My father admired his mother greatly; he never said so, but I could tell. I only knew her when she was crazy. She held it together during the war, and cracked after.\r\n \r\nOne night, I was writing “A Couch in New York” to please my father – thinking that it would bring in money and that money would finally satisfy him. My uncle (by marriage) told me how devoted my father was to his mother (whom I’d only known after she became crazy), more than to their father. That gave me some space to breathe, let me feel somewhat relieved. But it meant I had to save myself. If I didn’t, as a daughter who’s always withdrawn, what would I become? In a clinic my whole life, like one of my aunts.\r\n \r\nGODARD (JEAN-LUC), “PIERROT LE FOU” (1965)\r\nNB: You’ve often talked about how “Pierrot le Fou” began your love for cinema.\r\n \r\nCA: Yes, it was like nothing I’d seen before. I didn’t know that films could be like that. It gave me the force, the desire, this crazy desire to become a director. But watching it again, I don’t like it as much. Well, it depends. I love the part in the South and that song, ‘Ma ligne de chance’.\r\n \r\nNB: And the explosion?\r\n \r\nCA: Oh, of course, the explosion most of all. ‘Shit, shit, shit’.\r\n \r\nHITCHCOCK (ALFRED), “VERTIGO” (1958)\r\nCA: “Vertigo” is visually sublime, a film about fetishism – that is, on not seeing the other person, making them an extension of yourself, reducing and denying them to feed your own anxieties. There are so many other things to say about this movie.\r\n \r\nNB: As Lacan put it, a man can never see a woman.\r\n \r\nCA: It’s a nice phrase. But then, what are men and women? For the woman, it has to happen as a fantasy, it’s not sex that makes her orgasm; she can be more polymorphous, like a baby. Patriarchal teaching makes her think it has to take place in the orifices, when it really happens somewhere else, without her needing to fetishise her own sex like men do.\r\n \r\nICONOPHOBIA\r\nNB: You’re coming back from Cambodia, a country that’s gone through a sort of collective survival. For you, how was this trip through what they used to call the Third World?\r\n \r\nCA: I had a great experience. If you don’t know the history there, you can’t imagine. You can sense that a generation is missing, but you won’t see any evidence in the individuals or, rather, they don’t let you notice. Everyone keeps smiling, happy, nice. You end up wondering how genocide was possible. The Jews feel the trauma. What really surprised me was the reaction of the little girl who plays the young Nina. She was six years old, she didn’t want me to leave; when I proposed her coming to New York with me, she asked the translator if I had a good heart. It’s the aftermath of genocide: the most important thing becomes kindness. Natalia [Shakhovskaïa], a cello teacher, would say it, too; she’d lived in a world of constant denunciations where they had to keep the water running so the sounds of their talking wouldn’t be heard. In that kind of world, it’s essential you know who’s got a good heart.\r\n \r\nBut Cambodia isn’t the only Third World. I never went to Africa, as a filmmaker I couldn’t have; you had to go as a doctor. In Judaism, in principle, images can’t be exhibited; it’s a religion that bans images. It’s got to be part of me: I could never show people dying. I’ve seen it in some films, in those of a young Austrian filmmaker, a dead baby in front of his camera, or even in Depardon’s “Faits divers” (1983) where he films a dead body right after its suicide, while someone asks him to stop. For me it’s murderous, a crime.\r\n \r\nNB: Abbas Kiarostami also filmed a child dying in “ABC Africa” (2001). But in the face of catastrophe, what to do?\r\n \r\nCA: I can point the way, show the places the bodies are buried. It’s better to evoke, it gets to you and the viewers more effectively. In the end, those literal-minded images aren’t effective, you have to find another path, so that people confronting it can remain themselves and absorb it, actually face-to-face with the images. It’s why I tend to film things frontally.\r\n \r\nNB: But a face from the front, against a wall, is a Byzantine, formal schema and there’s nothing more idolatrous. It’s because of the close-up, as Jean Epstein put it, that cinema generates gods.\r\n \r\nCA: But it’s material and it moves, even when it seems fixed. And when you avoid low angles and subjective shots, you avoid fetishism. When you film frontally, you put two souls face to face equally, you carve out a real place for the viewer. So, it’s not God-like. You contemplate something that’s fixed. Not an eyelid batting, not a beat skipping.\r\n \r\nNB: So your conception of the image is a battle fought on two fronts: on the one front against literal-mindedness; and, on the other, against the production of idolatrous images.\r\n \r\nCA: Yes, literal-mindedness closes you off so often. Or rather, it depends what you call literal-mindedness. There’s something for the Jews like ethical order, which concerns the relationship to the Other, something Levinas analysed so well. You’re face to face with the Other. It’s from this crucial face-to-face that your sense of responsibility begins. Levinas would say, ‘now that you understand, you can’t murder’. That’s my idea of ethics. It’s why I want equality, always, between the image and the spectator. Or the passage from one unconscious toward the other.\r\n \r\nINDIVIDUAL\r\nNB: The cinema creates prototypes for ways of living, ways to reside in the world. In your work, we can see how you constantly interweave two types of individuals: the sovereign individual, responsible for his/her acts, inventing his/her freedom; and the individual who’s a victim to him/herself, prey to moments of total anonymity.\r\n \r\nCA: Yes, that’s probably true. It takes ten men to carry a corpse or sing the Kaddish. They can’t be done alone. Besides which, you have to be sure of yourself, without glorifying the individual too greatly. That’s why I’ve been in analysis for ten or twelve years, on and off. I take a breath, I step back. Am I conscious of being an individual? I know that I’m just myself, even though I don’t know what it means to be oneself. My analyst is like a friend of mine; I repeat the same things all the time, stories or situations taken from the Bible – in particular the Judgment of Solomon, in which the good mother is revealed. And of the forty years the Jews spent in the desert to lose all trace of slavery: something the blacks and concentration camp victims didn’t have. The idea is sublime: taking time to shed the traces. Traces of slavery. For the camps, it will take three generations, they say. My youngest niece is sick to her stomach, she’s 27, the third generation. As for my mother, she’s waiting to become a great-grandmother; she’s waiting for the fourth generation.\r\n \r\nINSTALLATION\r\nNB: Since 1995 and “D’Est: au bord de la fiction (From the East: Bordering on Fiction)”, you’ve done installations regularly across the world, for example “Woman Sitting after Killing” in 2001, “Une voix dans le desert (A Voice in the Desert)” in 2003, “Women from Antwerp” in November in 2008. Often, although not always, the material of these installations re-emerges in your films. How do you navigate between them?\r\n \r\nCA: An installation piece is cinema without the hassles – that is, without all the humiliating terms of production. It’s free of all the burdens of cinema. I can work alone, at home, without waiting to find the money. It’s artisanal work – practically by hand – which I adore; there’s nothing like it.\r\n \r\nNB: How do you ‘install’ yourself in all this material you gather?\r\n \r\nCA: The process is much closer to documentary than fiction. For a documentary, I become an empty sponge: if you start off with a preconceived idea, you’ll obtain it – but you won’t see a thing. When I lock myself in with the material for an installation, it’s like shooting a documentary: you don’t know what will happen, you sculpt your material, it arranges itself on its own. And then, in the blink of an eye, it’s suddenly there, it’s self-evident. For fiction, there has to be a structure with a requisite beginning and ending; you can move the elements around, but you can’t change which way they face; you have to follow the thread between them. With installations, I don’t follow that thread, and it’s magical: multiple possibilities can arise while I work out the material, and that material pulls me on. I work on it, it becomes something else, and then I’m there. Creation comes from transformation; the process is liberating and riveting, a pure joy.\r\n \r\nNB: What are the differences in your installations, as you see their evolution from 1995?\r\n \r\nCA: The main ones are exploring alternate forms to a single-minded fiction, and leaving new spaces open for the viewer. The technical devices have changed, some are more complex. Not all the installations are tied to my films. I conceived the last one, “Maniac Summer” (2009), out of some original images, and some that were nearly random. I wanted the installation to be a series of abandoned films left in-progress, as if marked by persistent traces after a violent dispersion. The ghosts of Hiroshima gave it its underlying structure. Better if I read you the text written for the occasion:\r\n \r\nEssentially: from one orphaned film to another, in progress.\r\nWithout subject or object.\r\nWithout start or end.\r\nA film that implodes.\r\nBetween Eden and catastrophe.\r\n \r\nIn progress. In shards. Shards of catastrophes.\r\nA film that reproduces itself at least four times, maybe five, as it’s taken toward catastrophe, as the speed of light seems to be surpassed.\r\nLike at Hiroshima. And like at Hiroshima, it leaves its traces, but in progress.\r\n \r\nA film that explodes and floats before dying.\r\nNext to it, the phantoms still are swaying. They continue their danse macabre.\r\n \r\nA film that replicates itself until it has lost its colours, like shadows, phantoms, traces.\r\nA film that comes together in a landscape,\r\nAnd drifts apart.\r\nFrom black and white to white and black.\r\nAlmost unidentifiable.\r\nOften almost abstract forms.\r\nThat’s how it will become an orphaned film.\r\nWithout author, without subject, nor object. Silent.\r\n \r\nJEANNE DIELMAN\r\nNB: Your work includes a number of self-portraits, and one majestic figure who totally innovated the relationship between portraiture and narrative: the figure of a mother, Jeanne Dielman.\r\n \r\nCA: While I was writing it, I didn’t understand “Jeanne Dielman”. I didn’t understand it until many years later: it was also a film on lost Jewish rituals, not just about an obsessive woman. If she’s so obsessive, it’s to avoid leaving an hour open to anxiety. And when that extra hour arrives, all her anxiety surfaces.\r\n \r\nI understood it after the mental crisis and analysis. I wanted my mother to keep the Sabbath, to light the candles; it came from the death of my father’s father (my mother’s father died in the camps), the man who had accepted me as a girl. At his death, I was still little; they took me out of Jewish school overnight, and it was a shock, since it broke off another connection to my grandfather. To keep the Sabbath, for me, meant reviving my ties with this man who had accepted me as a girl. It’s a really beautiful ritual, powerful and even philosophical when you grasp it. The idea of the ritual has to do with the passage from animal to human. According to the dietary rules, you have to know what’s a milk-product, or product of other foods, you have to think before eating. I like that idea.  I don’t keep kosher, but at least I know the basics. I know why you can’t eat shellfish: because they never fully developed.\r\n \r\nNB: You make me think of Ken Jacobs, who’s explained once that “Tom, Tom, the Piper’s Son” (1969) is a film about a Jewish ritual of sexual initiation.\r\n \r\nCA: A lot of sexual rites are made so that men might think a little before fucking women. In Judaism, the man is required to please his wife. If not, it’s grounds for divorce. One of my cousins got divorced for just that reason. Friday night, the man has to please his wife, so that he has to get to know her, for five minutes he has to forget about himself. You don’t have to be a believer to subscribe to that. Unfortunately, the ultra-orthodox have changed all this, and often for the worse.\r\n \r\nNB: What was your experience like at the film’s release?\r\n \r\nCA: At Cannes, after the screening, the first one up was Marguerite Duras. Right away she tried to dismiss the film. She said that she wouldn’t have filmed the murder, she would have made a ‘chronicle’. I don’t think she understood anything. She said, ‘that woman’s crazy’, so she could relate the character to her own world. I was furious. For me that woman was like all the women I’d known as a child. Were they crazy or was it a way to fight against craziness, anxiety?\r\n \r\nMarguerite built up airs around herself that she would promote and flaunt non-stop. With Agnès [Varda], we were sometimes competitive, but Agnès is capable of moments of great generosity toward women, where Marguerite was only capable of generosity to men; she loved them madly. It would have been better if I hadn’t met her. We spent three months together, since “Jeanne Dielman” and “India Song” came out at the same time and were shown side-by-side at all the festivals. Marguerite was often on the bad side, first during the war, then with the Communist Party … but there are these flashes in her work; I went to see “Eden Cinema” (1977) on stage, and it was magnificent. And, deep down, I nevertheless liked her.\r\n \r\nReally, it’s always better not to meet ‘the creators’. Whenever anyone tells me, I love your work, I’d like to meet you, I always say: it’s better not to. I’ll disappoint you.\r\n \r\nLEVINAS (EMMANUEL)\r\nNB: You followed Levinas’ seminars much more closely than Deleuze’s or Lacan’s.\r\n \r\nCA: Yes, every Saturday I went to ENIO [École Normale Israélite Orientale] at Michel-Ange Auteuil [subway stop]. Lévinas would interpret the verse of the week. Throughout the whole year he’d interpret the Bible, make a student translate a verse and, then, sitting so small on his chair, surrounded by books, he’d start the exegesis: Rashi, Maimonides, etc … The way we learned was by questioning, negation, but mostly questioning. To go to a yeshiva [Jewish religion school] means learning the art of questioning and negation, and this after millennia, after the Hebrew Bible. The Talmud means learning to discuss, to call things into question, to develop your thoughts.\r\n \r\nNB: To acquire a dialectical sense.\r\n \r\nCA: I don’t think dialectics is the appropriate word. No. And, anyway, it’s a word that’s too associated with Marxism, even if Marx was Jewish and, one way or another, he would have been rooted in this sort of practice of reflection and still more reflection.\r\n \r\nNB: Did you keep any traces from Levinas’ seminars?\r\n                                                                   \r\nCA: No, I didn’t take notes and I forgot everything after my first breakdown. Since then, my memory’s been worse. It was a real disaster, just before “Golden Eighties”, which hadn’t been made as I wanted.\r\n \r\nNB: I remember just how out of place and explosive it seemed in the landscape of the time; nobody was expecting such a joyous, colourful musical. That kind of exhilaration ran completely against the dominant taste in auteur films of the ‘80s.\r\n \r\nCA: They kept wanting me to remake “Jeanne Dielman”, but I wanted to spurn everything – spurn my father’s name, not repeat myself. I did a number of trial runs for it, and “Les Années 80 (The ‘80s)” and the others are possibly more joyous than the final film, which suffered from a lack of resources, among other reasons. In any case, I was very happy to write the songs. [She sings]\r\n \r\nMÉNILMONTANT\r\nNB: Why did you decide to live in this underprivileged district of Paris?\r\n \r\nCA: I don’t consider it underprivileged – on the contrary. I love living in this hybrid neighborhood; I’ve lived here for 20 years, and before that at 107 rue de Ménilmontant. Like every town, there’s a local crazy guy, Gaspard, and the village takes care of him. The building across the way includes 89 different nationalities. I’ve seen children grow up, the building decay; nobody does anything. A young man was thrown through a window, they amputated his leg. Now he spends his life on a bench with a giant radio listening to rap. When I go past him, he always says ‘How’s it going, Chantal?’ Oh, it’s going well. Sometimes he says ‘Madame Chantal’.\r\n \r\nMURNAU (F.W.), TABU (1931)\r\nCA: Such simplicity, such economy, such beauty in how it treats its young characters. Such horror toward the persecutors. I love “Sunrise” (1927) too, but in “Tabu” things go worse, the couple doesn’t recover like in “Sunrise”. There’s no good and bad woman.\r\n \r\nNB: In “Almayer’s Folly”, the shot of the boat with all the young people asleep seems like a cross between “Tabu” and “The Night of the Hunter” (1955).\r\n \r\nCA: It’s possible. I don’t have any visual memory, only emotional; I don’t remember exact shots, only what they evoked for me.\r\n \r\nNO\r\nNB: Often, when someone asks you a question, your first impulse is to answer ‘No’. Like a lot of writers and artists, you’ve been given a powerful instinct for contradiction; you make me think of Faust’s line in Goethe: ‘the instinct that always says no’.\r\n \r\nCA: But no! [Laughing] I answer no when the answers imprison me in a grid, a system of interpretation. And I don’t want to take it, to accept being simplified. But after saying no, I open up. When I know a topic really intimately, I want to take my time to explain it well and open up. I don’t want to hold just one thought; I want to have different thoughts that can play on different perspectives. So I say no when I find myself in the grips of some ‘agenda’ for example. One of the people I’ve really loved to have a dialogue with on art is Lynne Cooke, an Australian curator. She asks questions wonderfully, always in this open way. The first time we met, it was the day after the wrap party for “D’Est”; I’d drunk too much the whole night, I’d barely slept. Suddenly the bell rings, I open the door, and she’s there. I don’t remember anymore if I was even supposed to see her. I didn’t even know who she was. She’s pure in a way without being a purist. And she’s made me think a lot, one of the best thinkers when it comes to art these days, I think.\r\n \r\nNB: What contemporary artists interest you?\r\n \r\nCA: Richard Serra, always – for me he’s the greatest sculptor, the greatest visual artist. To enter into his sculptures is to forget time and space, to be immersed in a physical geometry, which I love. In music, Kurtag, Scelsi and Monteverdi.  In ‘68, Stockhausen’s “Momente” came as a real shock, my first shock of contemporary music. Everything he’s done chorally is very beautiful.\r\n \r\nIn 1971-3, when I was in New York, I was plunged into the discovery and emergence of all these aesthetic ideas. I especially loved Charlemagne Palestine, Phil Glass ... but now Phil Glass, it’s turned into such a simple system, it doesn’t interest me anymore. The others are still looking.\r\n \r\nNOVEL [ROMAN] AND FAMILY ROMANCE [ROMAN FAMILIAL]\r\nNB: In “Almayer”, Marc Barbé and Stanislas Merhar represent the two faces of the same father figure, the one an evil wheeler-dealer, the other a passive lover who lets himself get carried off in the dreams of adventure of the first; and both of them taking care of the girl, Nina, in the same ways. Otherwise, we don’t know why it’s Lingard (Marc Barbé) who pays for Nina’s board, rather than Almayer.\r\n \r\nCA: I hadn’t thought of that. That comes from the book. But Barbé offers more of a paternal image than Stanislas. He’s the bad father – that’s why I put him in a tuxedo, we imagine he spends all his nights at the cabaret. He’s not an adolescent like Stanislas; he’s a man, with all the bullshit men will float, and the idiotic dreams of money with which he infects Almayer.\r\n \r\nNB: In Conrad’s book, the character of the young man, Daïn, plays a much more central role. In the film, we see very little of him.\r\n \r\nCA: I shot more scenes with him, but they overloaded the film. In fact Daïn belongs to the dreams of the Chinese man, because he dreams of the best for Nina. I wanted a nice, sweet scene when Daïn meets Nina.\r\n \r\nNB: In the book, Daïn leads an anti-colonialist revolt. In the film, you’re explicit that he could have been an insurgent who was trafficking in drugs or arms. The battles for liberation that form the backdrop of Conrad’s book aren’t even hinted at in the film. It wasn’t a loss, diminishing the character so much?\r\n \r\nCA: It would have had to go into a history of the country. That would be another film.\r\n \r\nNB: Where does the first scene of the film come from? It’s not in the book. Did you improvise it on location?\r\n \r\nCA: No, it was written. For Nina’s song, I hesitated before taking Mozart’s ‘Ave Verum’ in Latin, a Christian song in a greasy nightclub – but it’s more amusing and totally out of place. It’s one of the few songs I learned in school.\r\n \r\nNB: Why did you decide to play the voice of the Mother Superior, i.e., within the film, the source of harassment and the law?\r\n \r\nCA: I didn’t decide to. At the moment of filming, someone said to me, ‘do it’. When I say, ‘he’s one of us’, it’s a phrase from my father.\r\n \r\nNB: I thought it was a phrase from Tod Browning’s “Freaks” (1932), that awful refrain: ‘one of us’.\r\n \r\nCA: No, it’s a question that my father always asked, ‘is he one of us?’\r\n \r\nPAJAMA\r\nNB: While you’re shooting, how do you set up a communal lifestyle?\r\n \r\nCA: Each film is different, and finds its own life, its own grounds. The rules develop on their own, and are not spoken, even if that means they’re not rules. I don’t need to establish hierarchies. For “Jeanne Dielman”, I got into an argument with a sound mixer. She thought we were going to make the film collectively – it was the great era of Maoism. She would judge Delphine, since Delphine came from the haute-bourgeoisie. But it was Delphine who was taking the most risks for the film, not her. Rules prevent us from living. I go out in my pajamas, I’ve dispensed with fashion. I filmed all of my last film in pajamas. Today, I’m in my pajamas.\r\n \r\nNB: You had a follower in Michael Jackson, who showed up one morning in pajamas for his trial.\r\n \r\nCA: Michael Jackson was the master of transformations, nothing could stop him from remaking himself.\r\n \r\nNB: In the end, nobody could assign Michael Jackson an identity anymore. He was the human being who transformed into a type of transformer.\r\n \r\nCA: Yes.\r\n \r\nNB: I remember how the example of Michael Jackson helped certain of my mixed-race students.\r\n \r\nPASOLINI (PIER PAOLO), “MAMMA ROMA” (1962)\r\nCA: I love this woman. Her generosity. I feel sad for her when she gives the money to the gigolo. Her son dies like another Christ – that’s a weakness of the film, for me, without a doubt because I have a sort of revulsion towards Catholicism. Unfairly, I’m sure. The film is great, not for its fiction, but its documentary dimension, with Anna Magnani as female character. When she’s walking with the other prostitutes during that uneven tracking shot, clearly taken from a car, and you follow along in her joy and that of the other women – for just this shot, the film is very great.\r\n \r\nA PLACE ON EARTH\r\nCA: I look at how determinedly my mother wants to live, even though everything in her is falling apart. She’s got a lively spirit, completely the opposite of me. Because, for 15 years, before being taken to the camps, she could believe in the world. While for me, I was born into trauma. My sister Sylviane and I, we’ve had to take care of her these past three months but, even on a stretcher, when my mother sees a handsome young man, she flirts. Me, I was born with anxieties. My mother never let me negotiate a real separation from her – or maybe I’m the one who couldn’t do it, as I have trouble even existing. When I was little, since I knew how much she’d suffered, I let her have her own space. I would never cry, never say no. Little by little, I’ve realised to what extent, when I was younger, I didn’t have the space to be a woman. My mother still calls me ‘mon amour’ all the time, I can’t stand it. In Judaism, you’re not required to love your parents, only respect them. Sometimes I don’t feel either love or respect and, sometimes, the very next day, there’s too much of it. My mother’s mother died in the camps, so she didn’t have to take care of her when she was old. The last time my mother broke something, she fell down in the night but, thanks to the adrenaline she didn’t feel anything for a little while. The next day, I had to take her to the clinic; I said to her, ‘Mama, you’re not 18 anymore, when you go in somewhere, turn on the lights’; she’s 84, but she was so upset that she refused to eat for five days. There was nothing to do, I told myself: ‘She’s letting herself die, it’s her choice, like the old dogs who’d rather not eat so they can die’. My sister came and, since my mother has a completely different relationship with my sister, she’s started eating again.\r\n \r\nNB: You think that your mother denied you any right to existence?\r\n \r\nCA: Oh, I don’t know, it’s all too complicated. Sometimes, I think so. Sometimes, I hope for her death – in the sense that she would have to die in me. Not the woman, of course. Just the mother. But, in the end, I know it won’t change anything.\r\n \r\nPOVERTY\r\nNB: We can infer that your never asking for anything, of being content with so little, even depriving yourself – that this structures both your relationship to the world, and a style that’s characterised primarily by asceticism.\r\n \r\nCA: I understood right away that my parents had nothing, that I couldn’t have anything or ask for anything. When I do have something, I have to toss it away, disperse it to the winds. I don’t have any great needs; when I was little, I was always put in the background so my mother could have her own life and room to herself, since she’d suffered so much in the camps. Well, that’s what I tell myself now. In any case, I never showed signs of anger; above all, I couldn’t make her suffer.\r\n \r\nI wore my cousin’s clothes, which didn’t bother me. My father put me into Jewish school and, in 1956, there was already a class of parents who had remade their fortunes. Their children got their clothes from Dujardin’s, like today kids buy brand-names. When I was 13 or 14, for the first time, my mother directly gave me the money that my aunts had entrusted to her for my birthday. I went to Dujardin’s to buy a polo shirt, and immediately realised I was being foolish; it was the last time I did anything like that. Everyone was going to the beach at Knokke-le-Zoute, to the same place. The beach was divided up by windbreakers, and everyone would be at the same spot, ‘Viaene’. Everybody would change in the little cabins in the woods; sitting in the beach chairs, all the mothers had on these sublime clothes and sunglasses. But my mother was the most beautiful. All the kids had bicycles. My father rented one for me at five Belgian francs a half-hour. The kids played tennis, but I played ping-pong, because it was free. Their ice cream had three scoops, and mine had one.  But I could see how much my father was working, and I didn’t want to ask him for anything, or to reveal anything on the surface. One of my aunts was even poorer, I kept 25 cent coins for her. I didn’t want to eat; my mother was going crazy. When my sister was born, things got better. When she became a teenager, she immediately wanted a bicycle, a record player. She went to Kadio-radio to try to get a record player. I was astonished.\r\n \r\nNB: You transformed this existential asceticism into a style, this rigorousness into minimalism.\r\n \r\nCA: Maybe. I made something of it. But it always means remaining secondary, never fighting for my films enough, never claiming a ‘social’ place for them, compared to many other directors. How could a child come to tell herself these things? What had someone gotten through to me, that I’d internalised so much? I can’t explain it. When I was little and my parents would go out, I never cried. When my sister was born, my mother said, ‘Chantal’s not jealous’. So you internalise it, and you’re proud of not being jealous. In all my emotional relationships, I’m not jealous, so I can keep proving this decree, which was more powerful than it would have been if it were issued as an order. My psychoanalyst tells me, ‘You’ve accumulated so much rage, it could explode’. I’m scared of killing someone if it comes out. Everything is tied to the war and the camps; as a little girl, I had recurring nightmares, two that recurred the most often. In the first, Hitler was perched up on a giant chair in a camp and the Jews were playing violin with clenched smiles, like something out of Pina Bausch, making a circle. In the second dream, there was nothing to eat, and so people were being eaten. They were going to hang us, my mother and me, from butcher’s hooks. I was so little and I managed to run away. At my house, I found my mom again, but only felt guiltier for having saved myself. Where did it come from? At my house, I’d hear the word Läger, ‘camp’, a lot in Polish, I must have surmised what had happened to my mother in the camps. But she never said anything, or almost never.\r\n \r\nI was so scared to go to sleep, I asked my mom to repeat ‘Bonne nuit, Chantal’, ‘Goodni',NULL),(194,1,'2016-05-24 14:54:55','2020-11-24 01:31:59',4,'Postscript',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'postscript',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Postscript',_binary 'POSTSCRIPT: CHANTAL AKERMAN\r\n\r\nRICHARD BRODY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Belgian-born, Paris-based director Chantal Akerman died on October 5th, at the age of sixty-five. According to Isabelle Regnier, of Le Monde, she committed suicide. Neither Akerman’s name nor her work is as widely known as it should be. It is no overstatement to say that she made one of the most original and audacious films in the history of cinema, “Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du commerce, 1080 Bruxelles.” It premièred at the Cannes Film Festival, in May, 1975, the month before her twenty-fifth birthday.\r\n\r\nAkerman was younger than Orson Welles was when he made “Citizen Kane,” younger than Jean-Luc Godard was when he made “Breathless.” The three films deserve to be mentioned together. “Jeanne Dielman” is as influential and as important for generations of young filmmakers as Welles’s and Godard’s first films have been. Akerman presented monumentally composed, meticulously observed, raptly protracted images of a woman’s domestic routine—Jeanne (Delphine Seyrig) preparing cutlets in her kitchen, for instance. These images prove cinematically that the domestic lives of women are the stuff of art; that women’s private lives are as ravaged by the forces of history as are lives lived on the public stage of politics; and that the pressures of women’s unquestioned, unchallenged, and unrelieved confinement in the domestic realm and in family roles is a societal folly that leads to ruin, a form of violence that begets violence.\r\n\r\n“Jeanne Dielman” is an intimate film of majestic choreography. It distills a cinephilic passion—for classic Hollywood melodramas, Godard’s long takes, Jacques Tati’s pointillistic comedy, and Jacques Rivette’s and Andy Warhol’s experiments in duration—into an utterly personal and distinctive form. It takes on the subjects and the clichés of melodrama, such as prostitution and murder—those, in particular, of so-called women’s movies—and extrudes them with a profoundly modern psychological resonance, as well as a political fury.\r\n\r\n“Jeanne Dielman” is also a Holocaust film, with a protagonist torn by her memories, as were Akerman’s own parents, who were Holocaust survivors. Akerman’s last film, “No Home Movie,” screening at the New York Film Festival tomorrow and Thursday, is a film of her mother, Natalia, in her Brussels apartment, and among the subjects that they discuss are the events leading to her deportation to Auschwitz and the attempt to return to ordinary life in Belgium after the war.\r\n\r\nIn effect, Akerman transformed the visual styles and narrative forms, the dramatic syntax and artistic codes of the modern cinema, into a woman’s cinema. Subjecting the art to a kind of free aesthetic psychoanalysis, she worked in a vast array of genres and forms. She made her personal life—and her body—the subject of her 1976 film, “Je, Tu, Il, Elle” (I, You, He, She), in which she plays the lead role, as a lesbian who travels to visit her ex-lover (Claire Wauthion). That year, in New York, she filmed one of the most resonantly painterly and personal city pictures, “News from Home,” the soundtrack of which features letters written to her by her mother. Her 1982 film, “Toute Une Nuit” (One Whole Night), is one of the most delicately choreographed of all love films, a fusion of observational documentary and the bittersweet theatrical precision of Max Ophüls’s exquisitely scathing romances. Her choreographic inventiveness fused with Pina Bausch’s in the 1983 documentary “One Day Pina Asked …,” as well as in the 1986 musical “Golden Eighties,” set in a Brussels shopping mall where the antic and seductive comings and goings are marked by the legacy and memory of the Second World War. (There, Seyrig plays yet another Holocaust survivor named Jeanne.)\r\n\r\nShe made one of the great cinematic coming-of-age dramas, “Portrait of a Young Girl at the End of the Nineteen-Sixties in Brussels,” one of the great documentary self-portraits, “Là-Bas,” and, in 2011, an ecstatic, hallucinatory yet trenchantly political adaptation of Joseph Conrad’s novel “Almayer’s Folly.” She anticipated that movies would burst the bounds of theatres to take up residence in museums and art galleries, creating installations based on several of her documentaries, and, in 2008, an original gallery installation, “Women from Antwerp in November,” a fusion of cinephilic consciousness and female identity that seemed like the seedwork for a new decade of dramatic features.\r\n\r\nAkerman also made a wildly rapturous, sinuously erotic Proust adaptation, “The Captive,” which came out in 2000. With its fusion of Hitchcock and Mozart, of frozen poses and burning desires, it’s nearly as radical a refraction of melodramatic forms and moods as was “Jeanne Dielman.” It’s also how I met Chantal Akerman.\r\n\r\nIn June, 2000, after the première of “The Captive,” at the Cannes Film Festival, it had its première screening in Paris. I was in Paris to do research for a Profile of Jean-Luc Godard, and I wanted to talk to Akerman about his work, because, famously, she was inspired, at the age of fifteen, to make films when she saw “Pierrot le Fou.” The listing for the screening of “The Captive” mentioned that Akerman would be on hand for a Q. & A., so I went in the hope of meeting her afterward.\r\n\r\nAnd that’s what in fact happened—but first I saw the film with astonished delight, and then witnessed the Q. & A, which was unlike any that I’ve ever seen, before or since. The audience was composed mainly of young people, of the age of college students or recent graduates, and, after the screening, they were eager to engage Akerman in discussion about the film. A young woman sitting behind me raised her hand; Akerman called on her, and the viewer asked a fairly complex question filled with academic language. Akerman responded sharply, “Is that how you talk to your friends?” The woman stayed silent; Akerman persisted, asking whether the question represented the way that the young woman talks in real life and wondering why that’s the way she chose to talk to Akerman.\r\n\r\nIt was a hard lesson for the young woman; it was a lesson for me, too. I would have hated to be on the receiving end of Akerman’s tirade—as, if I had asked a question first, I might well have been. If there’s one thing that Akerman achieved in her films, it’s the elevation of private life, of what’s extraordinary about what’s seemingly ordinary, into the apt matter of art. Her work is recklessly, freely personal, and she came before the audience that day in order to have a personal discussion in public. In a few harsh phrases, Akerman changed forever the way I think of—and approach—events onstage. She made me think about what I say and, with her emphasis on the intimate, the sincere, and the spontaneous, made me not overthink what I say.\r\n\r\nWhen I spoke with Akerman in the hallway after the screening, she gave me her phone number and address. When I called her soon thereafter, she invited me to visit and interview her at her apartment, in the Twentieth Arrondissement. There, she offered me chocolates from Belgium. While we talked, her phone rang. It was her mother, and they talked for a little while. She spoke with love about Godard’s films, but she also spoke about the sense that she got from one of his recent films, “JLG/JLG,” a cinematic self-portrait: “You watch it and say to yourself, ‘Oh, my, things aren’t going well for him at the moment.’ He must be really sad to make this film. I’ve rarely seen a film of his that gives me such an impression of sadness.”\r\n\r\nIt’s inevitable that, in the wake of Akerman’s death, her last film, “No Home Movie”—a title that twists doubly around itself to suggest a movie about no home, about the feeling of having no home—will give a terrifying impression of sadness. Its empty rooms and still foyers, blank doorways and yearning distances, the looming threat of death will inevitably, for now, seem to dominate the passionate and vital energies, the drive for creation and for life that inspire it as well.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW YORKER, Richard Brody, October 16, 2015\r\n',NULL),(224,1,'2017-08-30 10:59:14','2021-05-28 16:33:10',1,'Film Schedule',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'film-schedule',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								LOOKING, REALLY LOOKING!

(63 mins., digital)\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn “Chantal Akerman par Chantal Akerman,” the filmmaker turns a commission for “Cinéma, de notre temps” from ARTE, the French German Cultural Channel, into a study of herself. In her own way of creating a portrait of herself and the world, Akerman delivers a monologue accompanied by a montage of clips of her films from 1968 to 1996 — many of which we’ve presented since LOOKING, REALLY LOOKING! began in the summer of 2016. “Chantal Akerman par Chantal Akerman” lets us see what film historian Nicole Brenez so aptly described in “The Pajama Interview” of 2011. “To meet Chantal Akerman is to experience someone incomparable: a person of uncommon force, capable of wrestling a film from a well of the worst production problems; a person of immense vulnerability, to gauge the extent that she offers herself to others, provided they do not represent power of any sort, whether political, economic or symbolic; a creature capable of the most extraordinary gestures, small and large alike.\" —Nicole Brenez, “Chantal Akerman: The Pajama Interview,” originally published in the Viennale “Useful Book #1”publication: “Chantal Akerman, The Pajama Interview” (2011).\r\n<br><br>\r\nFRIDAY, MARCH 24, 7pm<br>\r\nLE DEMENAGEMENT (Moving), France, 1992.  (42 mins., digital)<br>\r\nLE JOUR OÙ (The Day When), 1997. (7 min., digital)\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn a script written by Akerman, a man stands in his new apartment in a state of inertia and dislocation. “Le Demenagement” records the man delivering an extended soliloquy, surrounded by boxes of his possessions. He cannot bring himself to unpack, as he is preoccupied with feelings of indecision and regret. Akerman circumscribes the man’s action within an interior space as she has in earlier films — be it a room, a corridor or inside a hotel — as seen in her films “La Chambre,” “Je, tu, il, elle” and “Hotel Monterrey.” In “Le Demenagement,” the inaction, limited views and extended shots place the viewer into real time with the character. As if staged for theatre, the protagonist in “Le Demenagement” is performed by Sami Frey whose portrayal invokes a sense of futility akin to Valdimir and Estragon in Samuel Beckett’s “Waiting for Godot.” Like “Chantal Akerman par Chantal Akerman,” this film was created for ARTE, the French television station, as one of a series of filmmakers’ monologues.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLE JOUR OÙ (The Day When), 1997. (7 mins., 35mm) <br>\r\nAkerman called “Le Jour Où” — “at its heart, a homage to Godard.” A self-portrait — a poetic portrait of the mind — an indelible film.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFRIDAY, MARCH 31, 7pm <br>\r\nNUIT ET JOUR (Night and Day), 1991. (90 mins.) Belgium/France/Switzerland. (90 mins.)\r\n <br><br>\r\nJulie and Jack live in a small flat near Boulevard Sebastopol. Now in Paris, they are a young couple from the provinces who spend their days making love and their nights apart, while Jack drives a taxi and Julie walks the streets, waiting for him to come home.  Their vague aspirations take a backseat to their constant passion. “Music” resonates throughout — Julie sings wordlessly alongside the soundtrack’s musical backdrop; sometimes she sings while walking and sometimes we merely hear her off-screen. In a post-modern take on Truffault’s \"Jules and Jim,\" Julie begins spending her nights with Joseph, who drives Jack’s taxi during the day. Although she is getting no sleep, Julie resists choosing one of them, as she says she loves both of them, but realizes she may need to take action when they begin sounding too similar. It is symbolic in Akerman’s use of interior space that a physical change to the couple’s apartment leads them to join the larger world. When it was first shown, Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" called \"Nuit et Jour\" “a small, seriously comic extravaganza.”\r\n<br><br>\r\nFRIDAY, APRIL 7, 7pm <br>\r\nTOUTE UNE NUIT (All One Night), 1982. Belgium/France/Netherlands/Canada. (86 mins.)\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn a departure from Akerman’s use of extended shots to simulate real time in a film, \"Toute une Nuit\" is a sequence of brief nocturnal encounters of over seventy strangers and lovers in various places on a warm summer’s night in Brussels. Akerman’s composing creates a rhythm which carries the various scenes through the entire film — through an entire night. Structured as much through music as through visuals, the couples drink, dance, embrace, listen to the juke box and part to a soundtrack of footsteps, slamming doors and other city sounds. A wholly nocturnal love story, \"Toute une Nuit,\" focuses on unknown individuals in vignettes which together choreograph a larger narrative of the possibility for passionate human connection. In remembering Akerman, film critic David Jenkins said of \"Toute une Nuit,\" “Akerman understood that an unflagging dedication to minutiae — finding a focus, then focusing some more — fueled her profound postulations about life, love, people, relationships, the whole bit. … a reminder that someone looked at the world – and also saw it.” — David Jenkins, film critic for \"The Guardian,\" October 6, 2015\r\n<br><br>\r\nFRIDAY, APRIL 14, 8pm <br>\r\nLA FOLIE D\'ALMAYER (Almayer’s Folly), 2011. Belgium/France. (127 mins.)\r\n<br><br>\r\nAkerman crosses boundaries, not only between the worlds of art and film, but between personal writing, literature and film. In 2000, Akerman’s first adaptation of a literary work for film was \"La Captive,\" based on \"The Prisoner,\" the fifth volume of Marcel Proust’s \"Remembrance of Things Past\" (1913). Akerman’s second to last film, \"La folie d’Almayer\" from 2011, is an adaptation of Joseph Conrad’s \"Almayer’s Folly\" published in 1895. Set in the 19th century, Conrad’s story centers on the life of a Dutch trader in the Borneo jungle and his relationship to his mixed race daughter who ultimately chooses her Malaysian identity over her father’s attempt to raise and educate her to be European. If like Proust, Akerman’s \"La Captive\" raises the question of never being able to know the “other” — between man and woman — Akerman’s \"La folie d’Almayer’s\" “other” is racial and cultural. In many scenes, one color subtly dominates: the green of nature, the blue of the moonlight or night, yellow streetlights, red in dimly lit areas. Almayer has chosen fidelity to profit, white superiority and culture, even though he remains alone in his deteriorating circumstances. At the conclusion, Almayer’s mind is irreparably destroyed. He dies unable to delude himself, leaving behind a daughter he’s wiped from his consciousness. While Conrad allows Almayer to die with a calm look, Akerman is not so kind. She ends in a final, minutes-long shot of the ravaged face of Almayer as he is forced to confront his folly. Akerman compassionately yet firmly, forces him to not forget. \r\n<br><br>\r\nFRIDAY, APRIL 21, 7pm <br>\r\nSUD (South), 1999. Belgium/France. (71 mins.)\r\n<br><br>\r\nInspired by the work of writers William Faulkner and James Baldwin, Akerman’s initial concept for “Sud” was a meditation on the American South. The racially motivated murder of James Byrd Jr. in the East Texas town of Jasper on June 7, 1998, radically shifted Akerman’s focus from the southern landscape to the rural landscape which held the emotional trauma and aftermath of Byrd’s murder in a community riven by its history of racism and Klan activity. Akerman imposes time and the tortuous death of Byrd on to the landscape and to the people mourning Byrd’s death. “Sud” is structurally and emotionally disrupted by Akerman’s prolonged tracking shots of Jasper’s landscape, undercut by interviews and the uncut and uncomfortably close-up perspective of the mourners at the memorial service for Byrd. In echoes of James Baldwin, the N.A.A.C.P. said at the time, “We call upon all Americans to stand up and be counted and to condemn this for the heinous crime that it is.” In “Sud” like in “D’est,” Akerman arrives at the boundary of language and the use of “graven images,” of the unrepresentable or inexpressible. “How do the trees and the whole natural environment evoke so intensely death, blood and the weight of history? How does the present call up the past? And how does the past, with a mere gesture or a simple regard, haunt and torment you as you wander along an empty cotton field or a dusty country road?” —Chantal Akerman\r\n<br><br>\r\nPOUR FEBE ELSABETH VELASQUEZ, EL SALVADOR. 1991. France, (4 mins.)\r\n<br><br>\r\nCommissioned by Amnesty International for its TV program “Ecrire contre l’oubli” (Write Against Oblivion), Akerman’s contribution in the form of a poem is dedicated to Febe Elisabeth Velasquez, an El Salvadorian trade unionist and mother of three, murdered by the US-backed junta. Deneuve emerges from the calm of a Parisian night to deliver a heartfelt plea for remembrance of Febe Elisabeth’s too short life. Sonia Wieder-Atherton’s cello weeps appropriately.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSATURDAY, MAY 6, 7pm<br>\r\nDE L’AUTRE COTE (From the Other Side), 2002. (103 mins.)\r\n<br><br>\r\n“They have stories to tell … unfortunately,” said Akerman. “Unfortunately,” because the stories Akerman hears are about death in the desert — the final resting place of Mexicans desperate for work who perish crossing the border into the United States. “De l’autre Cote” is filmed on both sides of the border between Arizona and Mexico. On one side is Agua Prieta, and on the other, Douglas. Akerman listens to an array of people in the town — Mexicans (in a doorway, a yard, an office, a restaurant), talking about relatives who disappeared, and Arizonans talking about the influx of illegal immigrants. Their stories shift us between empathy and compassion for the suffering of those on one side and disgust by the lack of compassion on the other side. In one sequence, an illegal immigrant reads out a proud, pained statement at a cafeteria table of his companions. By contrast, the film’s concluding monologue — recollections about a middle-aged Mexican maid who made it to San Diego, secured work, but one day disappeared — was Akerman’s own creation delivered in voiceover over nighttime highway footage. In long takes, Akerman films the dusty desert and flat border towns. U.S. helicopter night-vision footage shows a line of people attempting to cross illegally, caught only as ghostly silhouettes. Akerman is said to have read a news story on American ranchers who liked to hunt immigrants with their shotguns and night-vision goggles. “Long shots make you feel the journey… With those shots, you cannot forget them—because I insist. . . You have them in your body.” —Chantal Akerman\r\n<br><br>\r\n“Chilling! Stunningly composed… In a few deft interviews [the film] shows the hypocrisy and paranoia involved in U.S. immigration policy and its failure to acknowledge the economic dependence of the U.S. on undocumented laborers.” —Amy Taubin, “Film Comment,” 2012\r\n<br><br>\r\nSaturday, May 13, 4:30pm<br>\r\nNO HOME MOVIE, 2015. (115 mins.) <br>\r\nThe #1 Best Film of the Year” by Manohla Dargis, The New York Times.\r\n<br><br>\r\n“No Home Movie” is Chantal Akerman’s last film, a portrait of her mother, Natalia (Nelly) in the final months of her life. Chantal is present in the tidy Brussels apartment, sometimes away, and yet never far from her intimately entwined relationship with her mother, a survivor of the Holocaust. Her sister Sylviane arrives, Clara, the Mexican caretaker attends to her mother, and Chantal feels the push and pull between her will to forget and the desperate desire to know more of her mother’s story before it is irretrievable. Even now the kitchen is the locus of every day interactions, recalling the imprint her mother’s obsessive routines made on Akerman, seen in her 1975 masterpiece, “Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles.” Akerman interrupts the ways her camera looks on Nelly’s passing life (through a doorway, down a hallway, the furnishings, toward a window) with durational shots of the wind in the trees and across an arid desert landscape in Israel. In “No Home Movie” and “My Mother Laughs” (Ma mere rit), an “auto-portrait” Akerman wrote in 2013, Akerman gives voice to the precariousness of life. “I think if I knew I was going to do this, I wouldn’t have dared to do it.”\r\n<br><br>\r\n“Both elliptical and tryingly quotidian, ‘No Home Movie’ is a shattering contemplation of loss and grief as much as it is a search for identity and calm, for rootedness from a perpetually nomadic, breathless soul. It is not a home movie: it is a movie about having no home.” —Andrea Picard, “Cinema Scope”\r\n<br><br><br>\r\n\r\nPAST FILM SCREENINGS—FALL 2016\r\n<br><br>\r\nFRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 7pm<br>\r\nLETTRE DE CINÉASTE, Belgium, 1984. (8 mins., digital).<br>\r\nCHANTAL AKERMAN PAR CHANTAL AKERMAN, Belgium, 1996. (64 mins., video). (Postponed to a later date)<br>\r\nAUTOUR DE JEANNE DIELMAN, France, 1975. dir. Sami Frey, (78 mins., digital)\r\n<br><br>\r\nThis program presents three films across three decades on the work of artist/filmmaker, Chantal Akerman. Akerman directs two of the films in which she interrogates herself as subject alongside the nature and raison d’etre of cinema itself. In \"Lettre de Cinéaste\" (1984), Akerman with actor Aurore Clément as a kind of stand-in or proxy asks, What is cinema for? Who is it for? If the Mosaic prohibition on making graven images includes film images, where does that leave a Jewish filmmaker? Akerman turns a commission for \"Cinéma, de notre temps\" from ARTE, the French German Cultural Channel, into a study of herself in \"Chantal Akerman par Chantal Akerman\" (1996) in which she discovers her own feminized sensibility and another way of seeing the world and self through a monologue accompanied by a montage of clips of her films. Edited by Akerman, the final film is Sami Frey’s documentary video \"Autour de Jeanne Dielman\" (1975) shot on the set of \"Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles.” In one scene, Akerman and French actor and film director, Delphine Seyrig, are in the dressing room. In questioning Akerman on how she wants her to comb her hair, a frustrated Seyrig tells Akerman “when you explain something, you find you don’t want to explain it.”\r\n<br><br>\r\nFRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 8pm<br>\r\nLES RENDEZ-VOUS D’ANNA, France/Belgium/West Germany, 1978. (127 mins., 35mm). \r\n<br><br>\r\nBefore pursuing filmmaking, Chantal Akerman set out to be a writer. Like “Je tu il elle,” “Les Rendez-vous d’Anna” was originally written as a text, not a screenplay. Played by Aurore Clement, Anna Silver is a filmmaker Akerman described as “a sort of mutant… perhaps a heroine of the future.” Anna is seemingly rootless and traveling from city to city to promote her work; nomadism as a form of existential crisis. The film spans several days and three countries shot in trains, train stations, cinemas, car interiors and hotel rooms. Visits to Akerman’s parental home in Belgium are fleeting affairs—confessional intimacies between mother and daughter taken wherever they can. Hook-ups are easy-come/easy-go affairs and commitment is provisional. \"Anna, where are you?,\" a voice enquires. Anna may not know or much care.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSATURDAY, OCTOBER 1, 7pm<br>\r\nJE TU IL ELLE, France/Belgium, 1974. (86 mins., 16mm).\r\n<br><br>\r\nLike “Les Rendez-vous d\'Anna,” Akerman originally wrote “Je, tu, il, elle” as a short story. A set of minimalist constraints create a space for an exploration of utter dissociation. Appearing as herself in the film, Akerman compulsively rearranges her few items of furniture, eats only from a bag of sugar, writes and rewrites a letter to a real or potential lover (rearranging the various drafts in a series of piles like a game of solitaire), and takes off her clothes and drapes them over her body. From the start, the film makes it clear that we cannot trust temporal continuity. The first line corresponds to the last action of the film. The figures are physical but formal. White bodies on white sheets. The film provides neither catharsis nor thesis. “Her [Chantal Akerman] movies give cinema heft. They have the rigour of a Poussin painting. She looks longer and harder than most directors, and almost seems to stop film\'s flicker.\' —Mark Cousins, Edinburgh-based film director and critic. \r\n<br><br>\r\nTUESDAY, OCTOBER 4, 7pm<br>\r\nLE 15/8, France/Belgium, 1973. (42 mins., digital).<br>\r\nDIS-MOI (Tell Me), France, 1980. (45 mins., digital)<br>\r\nL’ENFANT AIMÉE OU JE JOUE À ÊTRE UNE FEMME MARIÉE, Belgium, 1971. (35 mins., 16mm)—POSTPONED\r\n<br><br>\r\nThese three early Akerman films (spanning the decade of the 1970s), bring together different structures by which the filmmaker finds her own voice. What “Le 15/08” shares with “L’enfant aimé” is a sense of domestic space in which life is represented as a rhythmical process, with pulse, form and function of all the parts made visible. The voice-over in “Le 15/08,” presents a stream-of-consciousness portrait of a young Danish woman in Paris. She is there looking for work, in an apartment that is not her own. Time passes, and her thoughts are heard. But there is also judgment and taking issue with the woman’s own body, presented as if the locus of criticism lies outside herself, a trope that seems to emerge from the mirror sequence of “L’enfant aimé.” “Aujourd’hui dis-moi” features a set of interviews conducted by Akerman as she travels from door to door in Paris, knocking and being invited inside by a series of elderly, respectable-looking ladies. Over coffee and cakes, these women, all Jewish from Eastern Europe and survivors of the Holocaust, share their dread tales, amid stories of food and love and family life. \r\n<br><br>\r\nFRIDAY, OCTOBER 7, 8pm<br>\r\nHISTOIRES D’AMÉRIQUE (AMERICAN STORIES: FOOD, FAMILY AND PHILOSOPHY), Belgium/France, 1989. (92 mins., DCP). English.\r\n<br><br>\r\nShot in New York, Akerman’s first English-language film “Histoires d’Amérique” conjures up an informal history of Jewish life over the past 100 years through a series of eyewitness accounts recreated by a group of largely unknown actors. Akerman explains, “Instead of learning my family\'s story directly from my parents, I had to turn to literature—[Isaac Bashevis] Singer. But his memories weren’t exactly mine, so I made up my own; this film is about memory, but an invented one.” The actors are all Jewish. Shot in a vacant lot in Brooklyn at night, they recite jokes and real-life stories that define what has survived and been transmitted from generation to generation. The trauma of the old world is never far from the new. Like the jesters or “badchen” who entertained at weddings in the old country, the actors move between comedy and intricate Talmudic references. “Histoires d’Amerique’s” ambivalence lies somewhere between Woody Allen’s “Broadway Danny Rose” and Samuel Beckett’s “Waiting for Godot.” As Akerman has said, “when history becomes impossible to bear, there is only one thing to do: send yourself up and laugh.” Nominated for the Golden Bear award, Berlin International Film Festival, 1989.\r\n<br><br>\r\nMONDAY, OCTOBER 10, 7pm<br>\r\nNEWS FROM HOME, France/Belgium/West Germany, 1976. (85 mins., 16mm). \r\n<br><br>\r\nAkerman returned to New York in 1976, after having completed her original and audacious film “Jeanne Dielman\" in Europe. She was travelling back to a city of decay (not decadence) with letters her mother wrote to her when she was in New York in 1972. “News from Home” unfolds in long observational shots interspersed with the soundtrack of a woman’s voice reading and bringing family news from Brussels, describing trips to the seashore and worries for her daughter in New York. Who is addressing whom is no simple matter. Akerman allows us to see and hear what she sees and hears—tall buildings, diners, late-night bookstores, and an indelible final shot, looking back from the Staten Island Ferry as it pulls away from lower Manhattan’s skyline. Sounds might be in sync or not. “Akerman has described her murmuring voice-over of her mother’s letters as psalmody (the singing of psalms or sacred canticles in public worship), which evokes a prayerful effect, the mingling of longing, a provoking of guilt and the offer of love. The closing scenes of departure and voyage play without the presence of a voice. Such an absence perhaps allows for a new note of optimism—to proceed, one must depart.”—Adam Roberts, A Nos Amours, London\r\n<br><br>\r\nMONDAY, OCTOBER 17, 7pm—POSTPONED<br>\r\nJ’AI FAIM, J’AI FROID, France, 1984.

Marianne Lambert (67min.)\r\n<br><br>\r\n“I Don’t Belong Anywhere” explores Chantal Akerman as a nomadic filmmaker and portrays Akerman in conversation with her collaborator, Claire Atherton, where she discusses the origins of her film language and charts her cinematic trajectory, one that never ceased to interrogate the meaning of her own existence. The film includes excerpts from many of Akerman’s 40-plus films made from 1968 to the time of her death in 2015.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFRIDAY, JUNE 24, 7pm <br>\r\nProgram introduction by writer, SARA JAFFE\r\n<br><br>\r\nDIS-MOI (Tell Me), 1980. dir. Chantal Akerman (45 min.)<br>\r\nDis-Moi  was commissioned for French TV and is the first film, after 10 years in filmmaking, in which Chantal Akerman—herself the daughter of an Auschwitz survivor—engages with the Holocaust through intimate discussions with three Jewish grandmothers, all of them survivors of the Shoah. Akerman conducts the interviews herself, bearing witness to stories told by these elderly women and how they have been cut off both from their pasts and themselves by the experience of such horror. \"And speak they do, movingly, affectingly, wonderfully. We learn as much in these few minutes as we should about the Shoah: yes, it was a terrible crime against humanity, that needs to be remembered and memorialized, but we also learn something elemental about life in the shtetl in Poland before the war (about bakery, tailoring, courtship, love), and so therefore the truth of what is lost. This is history as weft. The lineal facts may provide the warp, but without the weft we are unlikely to feel, because we all know what it is to sit beside a mother and hear the family history.” — Adam Roberts, The Huffington Post. French with new English Subtitles provided by A Nos Amours, London.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLÀ-BAS (Over There), 2006. dir. Chantal Akerman (79 min.)<br>\r\nLà-bas is one of Akerman’s most fragile and most powerful works in which she uses her own voice to personalize and narrate the visual images. For a month in Tel Aviv, Akerman points her lens outward through two large windows with blinds that filter the light of the exterior world. Apprehensive about a recent bombing, Akerman constructs a profound meditation on whether Israel is indeed the ‘promised land’ or merely a new form of exile. Akerman’s relationship with Israel is overwhelming and frustrating, a matter of love and hate. The vast untroubled waters have lapped these shores throughout human history. The sea is an image of freedom, or ease, of human concerns dwarfed. But as ever, it is back to the apartment, and the glimpse of a life outside, beyond the shutters. Winner of the Grand Prize at the Marseille International Documentary Festival and nominated for a French Cesar, in Là-bas Akerman, who was heavily influenced by structural  filmmakers like Michael Snow, “takes the aesthetic strategies of the minimalists and marries them to the humanist content that they suppressed. Fragile… and powerful.” — Amy Taubin, Film Comment. French and English with English Subtitles.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSATURDAY, JULY 16, 7pm<br>\r\nProgram introduction by dancer and choreographer, LINDA AUSTIN\r\n<br><br>\r\nUN JOUR PINA M’A DEMANDE (One Day Pina Asked), 1983. dir. Chantal Akerman (61min.)\r\n<br><br>\r\nBorn a decade apart, Chantal Akerman (1950–2015) and Pina Bausch (1940–2009) were two remarkable artists who redefined our cultural expectations. In theatrical dance works, Bausch took commonplace gestures and transformed them into extraordinary pageants, while Akerman choreographed wonderful cinematic compositions made of rhythmical everyday elements. In \"Un Jour Pina M’a Demandè,\" Chantal Akerman realized one of the greatest of all syntheses of dance and cinema. In her sublime 1983 film of Pina Bausch and her dancers, Akerman documents Bausch and her dance company for five weeks while they are on tour in Germany, Italy and France. The encounter is a meeting of sensibilities, a perfect combination of the filmmaker’s sage framing and the dancer’s flamboyant world-making.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBausch was one of the most significant figures of modern dance and the pioneer of a unique style drawn from the German theatrical dance tradition known as \"tanztheater.\" Akerman films the performers with a poised camera in audacious compositions which emphasize the dances’ visual counterpoint and overlapping rhythms by a framing that’s as much an act of blocking out as of depicting. Unlike the idealized vantage of Wim Wender’s \"Pina\" (2011), \"Un Jour Pina M’a Demande“ reproduces the pull between meaning and its impasse that structures Bausch’s dances. Focused under Akerman’s lens, Bausch’s oeuvre resolves as a matter of the quotidian, pathologized, its order deranged not through an absence but an acceleration of some underlying logic: something, in other words, like the readymade subject of an Akerman film.” —Courtney Fiske, Artforum.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"Un Jour Pina M’a Demandè\" captures the grace of bodies in motion both onstage and behind it, with dressing rooms filled with lithe, sinewy men and women slicking back hair, adjusting ties, reapplying makeup. In an interview, Akerman commented, “At first, I had been dazzled, I only saw the beauty, the aestheticism. But in making a film on her, I understood that in fact she makes you take pleasure in her sadism through formal beauty. But she’s a great artist.” —Chantal Akerman.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFRIDAY, JULY 29, 8pm<br>\r\nCHANTAL AKERMAN\'S SHORT FILMS, 1968 – 1997\r\n<br><br>\r\nThis hour and a half program is a series of up to ten short films by Chantal Akerman from her earliest film “Saute ma Ville” from 1968 to acclaimed and unknown films from 1971 up until 1997. The series brings together films which explore Akerman’s sexuality and life as a filmmaker such as “Le Chambre” (1972) and “J’ai Faim, J’ai Froid” (1984), along with “Rue Mallet Stevens” (1986) which introduces the music of cellist Sonia Wieder-Atherton and, in “Ecrire Contre L’oubli” (1991), Akerman engages with the plight of the tortured in El Salvador‘s civil war, an early film in her engagement with different geographies and human conflicts from the early 1990s until her death in 2015.

Her short fiction and criticism have appeared in publications including \"Fence,\"\" BOMB,\" \"NOON,\" \"Paul Revere’s Horse,\" \"matchbook\" and \"The Los Angeles Review of Books.\" \r\n\r\nJaffe co-edited “The Art of Touring” (Yeti, 2009), an anthology of writing and visual art by musicians drawing on her experience as guitartist for post-punk band ERASE ERRATA. \r\n\r\nShe is the co-founding editor of New Herring Press, a publisher of prose chapbooks. As of Fall 2016, she will be Visiting Assistant Professor of Creative Writing at the University of Oregon. \r\n\r\n\r\nBY SARA JAFFE\r\n\r\nChantal Akerman’s \"Dis-Moi\" opens with a shot of the filmmaker exiting a Metro station. She looks right, left, right, then turns to the left and begins walking. At least for the moment, this is her search, her journey. The first audio we hear, a conversation between Akerman and her mother, reinforces Akerman’s centrality in the film to come, suggests that we might be entering a work of autobiography. \r\n\r\nBut something shifts. Akerman ascends flights of stairs to sit in the dining rooms of older women, none of whom she seems to know, or know well. Though she is often in the frame, she rarely speaks. She has imprinted herself but ceded her centrality. The self is the jumping-off point, not the ultimate object of investigation. I’m implicated, the film tells us, but this is not my story. The self mobilizes the narrative without laying claim to it. \r\n\r\nThe other film being shown tonight, \"Là-Bas,\" bears more markers of conventional autobiography—the text is diaristic, overtly personal—yet the camera is always looking outward. Much of the film is shot out the window, through the narrow channel between the shades. Her perspective both saturates the frame and limits its scope—as any subjective viewpoint—any viewpoint—must do. \r\n\r\nThese films thus produce the self as both an absence and a presence, which manifests a compelling tension. This is not the manipulative tension of a talking-head documentary, where there’s a smugness or coyness to the author’s removal. It’s the implicit tension of being a person in the world. \r\n\r\nIn an interview in the \"Los Angeles Review of Books,\" Maggie Nelson was asked about the term “autotheory,” which she used to describe her book \"The Argonauts.\" Nelson says, ““I’m always looking for terms that are not ‘memoir’ to describe autobiographical writing that exceeds the boundaries of the ‘personal.’” There are certainly great divergences between Nelson’s project—which uses the personal as the starting point for broader critical and theoretical investigations—and Akerman’s, which “exceeds the personal” through a kind of self-effacement.

(115 mins.) \r\nThe #1 Best Film of the Year” by Manohla Dargis, The New York Times.\r\n\r\n“No Home Movie” is Chantal Akerman’s last film, a portrait of her mother, Natalia (Nelly) in the final months of her life. Chantal is present in the tidy Brussels apartment, sometimes away, and yet never far from her intimately entwined relationship with her mother, a survivor of the Holocaust. Her sister Sylviane arrives, Clara, the Mexican caretaker attends to her mother, and Chantal feels the push and pull between her will to forget and the desperate desire to know more of her mother’s story before it is irretrievable. Even now the kitchen is the locus of every day interactions, recalling the imprint her mother’s obsessive routines made on Akerman, seen in her 1975 masterpiece, “Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles.” Akerman interrupts the ways her camera looks on Nelly’s passing life (through a doorway, down a hallway, the furnishings, toward a window) with durational shots of the wind in the trees and across an arid desert landscape in Israel. In “No Home Movie” and “My Mother Laughs” (Ma mere rit), an “auto-portrait” Akerman wrote in 2013, Akerman gives voice to the precariousness of life. “I think if I knew I was going to do this, I wouldn’t have dared to do it.”\r\n\r\n“Both elliptical and tryingly quotidian, ‘No Home Movie’ is a shattering contemplation of loss and grief as much as it is a search for identity and calm, for rootedness from a perpetually nomadic, breathless soul. It is not a home movie: it is a movie about having no home.” —Andrea Picard, “Cinema Scope”\r\n\r\n\r\nPAST SCREENINGS—SPRING 2017\r\n\r\nFRIDAY, MARCH 17, 7pm\r\nCHANTAL AKERMAN PAR CHANTAL AKERMAN, Belgium, 1996. (63 mins., digital)\r\n\r\nIn “Chantal Akerman par Chantal Akerman,” the filmmaker turns a commission for “Cinéma, de notre temps” from ARTE, the French German Cultural Channel, into a study of herself. In her own way of creating a portrait of herself and the world, Akerman delivers a monologue accompanied by a montage of clips of her films from 1968 to 1996 — many of which we’ve presented since LOOKING, REALLY LOOKING! began in the summer of 2016. “Chantal Akerman par Chantal Akerman” lets us see what film historian Nicole Brenez so aptly described in “The Pajama Interview” of 2011. “To meet Chantal Akerman is to experience someone incomparable: a person of uncommon force, capable of wrestling a film from a well of the worst production problems; a person of immense vulnerability, to gauge the extent that she offers herself to others, provided they do not represent power of any sort, whether political, economic or symbolic; a creature capable of the most extraordinary gestures, small and large alike.\" —Nicole Brenez, “Chantal Akerman: The Pajama Interview,” originally published in the Viennale “Useful Book #1”publication: “Chantal Akerman, The Pajama Interview” (2011).\r\n\r\nFRIDAY, MARCH 24, 7pm\r\nLE DEMENAGEMENT (Moving), France, 1992.  (42 mins., digital)\r\nLE JOUR OÙ (The Day When), 1997. (7 min., digital)\r\n\r\nIn a script written by Akerman, a man stands in his new apartment in a state of inertia and dislocation. “Le Demenagement” records the man delivering an extended soliloquy, surrounded by boxes of his possessions. He cannot bring himself to unpack, as he is preoccupied with feelings of indecision and regret. Akerman circumscribes the man’s action within an interior space as she has in earlier films — be it a room, a corridor or inside a hotel — as seen in her films “La Chambre,” “Je, tu, il, elle” and “Hotel Monterrey.” In “Le Demenagement,” the inaction, limited views and extended shots place the viewer into real time with the character. As if staged for theatre, the protagonist in “Le Demenagement” is performed by Sami Frey whose portrayal invokes a sense of futility akin to Valdimir and Estragon in Samuel Beckett’s “Waiting for Godot.” Like “Chantal Akerman par Chantal Akerman,” this film was created for ARTE, the French television station, as one of a series of filmmakers’ monologues.\r\n\r\nLE JOUR OÙ (The Day When), 1997. (7 mins., 35mm) \r\nAkerman called “Le Jour Où” — “at its heart, a homage to Godard.” A self-portrait — a poetic portrait of the mind — an indelible film.\r\n\r\nFRIDAY, MARCH 31, 7pm \r\nNUIT ET JOUR (Night and Day), 1991. (90 mins.) Belgium/France/Switzerland. (90 mins.)\r\n \r\nJulie and Jack live in a small flat near Boulevard Sebastopol. Now in Paris, they are a young couple from the provinces who spend their days making love and their nights apart, while Jack drives a taxi and Julie walks the streets, waiting for him to come home.  Their vague aspirations take a backseat to their constant passion. “Music” resonates throughout — Julie sings wordlessly alongside the soundtrack’s musical backdrop; sometimes she sings while walking and sometimes we merely hear her off-screen. In a post-modern take on Truffault’s \"Jules and Jim,\" Julie begins spending her nights with Joseph, who drives Jack’s taxi during the day. Although she is getting no sleep, Julie resists choosing one of them, as she says she loves both of them, but realizes she may need to take action when they begin sounding too similar. It is symbolic in Akerman’s use of interior space that a physical change to the couple’s apartment leads them to join the larger world. When it was first shown, Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" called \"Nuit et Jour\" “a small, seriously comic extravaganza.”\r\n\r\nFRIDAY, APRIL 7, 7pm \r\nTOUTE UNE NUIT (All One Night), 1982. Belgium/France/Netherlands/Canada. (86 mins.)\r\n\r\nIn a departure from Akerman’s use of extended shots to simulate real time in a film, \"Toute une Nuit\" is a sequence of brief nocturnal encounters of over seventy strangers and lovers in various places on a warm summer’s night in Brussels. Akerman’s composing creates a rhythm which carries the various scenes through the entire film — through an entire night. Structured as much through music as through visuals, the couples drink, dance, embrace, listen to the juke box and part to a soundtrack of footsteps, slamming doors and other city sounds. A wholly nocturnal love story, \"Toute une Nuit,\" focuses on unknown individuals in vignettes which together choreograph a larger narrative of the possibility for passionate human connection. In remembering Akerman, film critic David Jenkins said of \"Toute une Nuit,\" “Akerman understood that an unflagging dedication to minutiae — finding a focus, then focusing some more — fueled her profound postulations about life, love, people, relationships, the whole bit. … a reminder that someone looked at the world – and also saw it.” — David Jenkins, film critic for \"The Guardian,\" October 6, 2015\r\n\r\nFRIDAY, APRIL 14, 8pm \r\nLA FOLIE D\'ALMAYER (Almayer’s Folly), 2011. Belgium/France. (127 mins.)\r\n\r\nAkerman crosses boundaries, not only between the worlds of art and film, but between personal writing, literature and film. In 2000, Akerman’s first adaptation of a literary work for film was \"La Captive,\" based on \"The Prisoner,\" the fifth volume of Marcel Proust’s \"Remembrance of Things Past\" (1913). Akerman’s second to last film, \"La folie d’Almayer\" from 2011, is an adaptation of Joseph Conrad’s \"Almayer’s Folly\" published in 1895. Set in the 19th century, Conrad’s story centers on the life of a Dutch trader in the Borneo jungle and his relationship to his mixed race daughter who ultimately chooses her Malaysian identity over her father’s attempt to raise and educate her to be European. If like Proust, Akerman’s \"La Captive\" raises the question of never being able to know the “other” — between man and woman — Akerman’s \"La folie d’Almayer’s\" “other” is racial and cultural. In many scenes, one color subtly dominates: the green of nature, the blue of the moonlight or night, yellow streetlights, red in dimly lit areas. Almayer has chosen fidelity to profit, white superiority and culture, even though he remains alone in his deteriorating circumstances. At the conclusion, Almayer’s mind is irreparably destroyed. He dies unable to delude himself, leaving behind a daughter he’s wiped from his consciousness. While Conrad allows Almayer to die with a calm look, Akerman is not so kind. She ends in a final, minutes-long shot of the ravaged face of Almayer as he is forced to confront his folly. Akerman compassionately yet firmly, forces him to not forget. \r\n\r\nFRIDAY, APRIL 21, 7pm \r\nSUD (South), 1999. Belgium/France. (71 mins.)\r\n\r\nInspired by the work of writers William Faulkner and James Baldwin, Akerman’s initial concept for “Sud” was a meditation on the American South. The racially motivated murder of James Byrd Jr. in the East Texas town of Jasper on June 7, 1998, radically shifted Akerman’s focus from the southern landscape to the rural landscape which held the emotional trauma and aftermath of Byrd’s murder in a community riven by its history of racism and Klan activity. Akerman imposes time and the tortuous death of Byrd on to the landscape and to the people mourning Byrd’s death. “Sud” is structurally and emotionally disrupted by Akerman’s prolonged tracking shots of Jasper’s landscape, undercut by interviews and the uncut and uncomfortably close-up perspective of the mourners at the memorial service for Byrd. In echoes of James Baldwin, the N.A.A.C.P. said at the time, “We call upon all Americans to stand up and be counted and to condemn this for the heinous crime that it is.” In “Sud” like in “D’est,” Akerman arrives at the boundary of language and the use of “graven images,” of the unrepresentable or inexpressible. “How do the trees and the whole natural environment evoke so intensely death, blood and the weight of history? How does the present call up the past? And how does the past, with a mere gesture or a simple regard, haunt and torment you as you wander along an empty cotton field or a dusty country road?” —Chantal Akerman\r\n\r\nPOUR FEBE ELSABETH VELASQUEZ, EL SALVADOR. 1991. France, (4 mins.)\r\n\r\nCommissioned by Amnesty International for its TV program “Ecrire contre l’oubli” (Write Against Oblivion), Akerman’s contribution in the form of a poem is dedicated to Febe Elisabeth Velasquez, an El Salvadorian trade unionist and mother of three, murdered by the US-backed junta. Deneuve emerges from the calm of a Parisian night to deliver a heartfelt plea for remembrance of Febe Elisabeth’s too short life. Sonia Wieder-Atherton’s cello weeps appropriately.\r\n\r\nSATURDAY, MAY 6, 7pm\r\nDE L’AUTRE COTE (From the Other Side), 2002. (103 mins.)\r\n\r\n“They have stories to tell … unfortunately,” said Akerman. “Unfortunately,” because the stories Akerman hears are about death in the desert — the final resting place of Mexicans desperate for work who perish crossing the border into the United States. “De l’autre Cote” is filmed on both sides of the border between Arizona and Mexico. On one side is Agua Prieta, and on the other, Douglas. Akerman listens to an array of people in the town — Mexicans (in a doorway, a yard, an office, a restaurant), talking about relatives who disappeared, and Arizonans talking about the influx of illegal immigrants. Their stories shift us between empathy and compassion for the suffering of those on one side and disgust by the lack of compassion on the other side. In one sequence, an illegal immigrant reads out a proud, pained statement at a cafeteria table of his companions. By contrast, the film’s concluding monologue — recollections about a middle-aged Mexican maid who made it to San Diego, secured work, but one day disappeared — was Akerman’s own creation delivered in voiceover over nighttime highway footage. In long takes, Akerman films the dusty desert and flat border towns. U.S. helicopter night-vision footage shows a line of people attempting to cross illegally, caught only as ghostly silhouettes. Akerman is said to have read a news story on American ranchers who liked to hunt immigrants with their shotguns and night-vision goggles. “Long shots make you feel the journey… With those shots, you cannot forget them—because I insist. . . You have them in your body.” —Chantal Akerman\r\n\r\n“Chilling! Stunningly composed… In a few deft interviews [the film] shows the hypocrisy and paranoia involved in U.S. immigration policy and its failure to acknowledge the economic dependence of the U.S. on undocumented laborers.” —Amy Taubin, “Film Comment,” 2012\r\n\r\n\r\nPAST FILM SCREENINGS—FALL 2016\r\n\r\nFRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 7pm\r\nLETTRE DE CINÉASTE, Belgium, 1984. (8 mins., digital).\r\nCHANTAL AKERMAN PAR CHANTAL AKERMAN, Belgium, 1996. (64 mins., video). (Postponed to a later date)\r\nAUTOUR DE JEANNE DIELMAN, France, 1975. dir. Sami Frey, (78 mins., digital)\r\n\r\nThis program presents three films across three decades on the work of artist/filmmaker, Chantal Akerman. Akerman directs two of the films in which she interrogates herself as subject alongside the nature and raison d’etre of cinema itself. In \"Lettre de Cinéaste\" (1984), Akerman with actor Aurore Clément as a kind of stand-in or proxy asks, What is cinema for? Who is it for? If the Mosaic prohibition on making graven images includes film images, where does that leave a Jewish filmmaker? Akerman turns a commission for \"Cinéma, de notre temps\" from ARTE, the French German Cultural Channel, into a study of herself in \"Chantal Akerman par Chantal Akerman\" (1996) in which she discovers her own feminized sensibility and another way of seeing the world and self through a monologue accompanied by a montage of clips of her films. Edited by Akerman, the final film is Sami Frey’s documentary video \"Autour de Jeanne Dielman\" (1975) shot on the set of \"Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles.” In one scene, Akerman and French actor and film director, Delphine Seyrig, are in the dressing room. In questioning Akerman on how she wants her to comb her hair, a frustrated Seyrig tells Akerman “when you explain something, you find you don’t want to explain it.”\r\n\r\nFRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 8pm\r\nLES RENDEZ-VOUS D’ANNA, France/Belgium/West Germany, 1978. (127 mins., 35mm). \r\n\r\nBefore pursuing filmmaking, Chantal Akerman set out to be a writer. Like “Je tu il elle,” “Les Rendez-vous d’Anna” was originally written as a text, not a screenplay. Played by Aurore Clement, Anna Silver is a filmmaker Akerman described as “a sort of mutant… perhaps a heroine of the future.” Anna is seemingly rootless and traveling from city to city to promote her work; nomadism as a form of existential crisis. The film spans several days and three countries shot in trains, train stations, cinemas, car interiors and hotel rooms. Visits to Akerman’s parental home in Belgium are fleeting affairs—confessional intimacies between mother and daughter taken wherever they can. Hook-ups are easy-come/easy-go affairs and commitment is provisional. \"Anna, where are you?,\" a voice enquires. Anna may not know or much care.\r\n\r\nSATURDAY, OCTOBER 1, 7pm\r\nJE TU IL ELLE, France/Belgium, 1974. (86 mins., 16mm).\r\n\r\nLike “Les Rendez-vous d\'Anna,” Akerman originally wrote “Je, tu, il, elle” as a short story. A set of minimalist constraints create a space for an exploration of utter dissociation. Appearing as herself in the film, Akerman compulsively rearranges her few items of furniture, eats only from a bag of sugar, writes and rewrites a letter to a real or potential lover (rearranging the various drafts in a series of piles like a game of solitaire), and takes off her clothes and drapes them over her body. From the start, the film makes it clear that we cannot trust temporal continuity. The first line corresponds to the last action of the film. The figures are physical but formal. White bodies on white sheets. The film provides neither catharsis nor thesis. “Her [Chantal Akerman] movies give cinema heft. They have the rigour of a Poussin painting. She looks longer and harder than most directors, and almost seems to stop film\'s flicker.\' —Mark Cousins, Edinburgh-based film director and critic. \r\n\r\nTUESDAY, OCTOBER 4, 7pm\r\nLE 15/8, France/Belgium, 1973. (42 mins., digital).\r\nDIS-MOI (Tell Me), France, 1980. (45 mins., digital)\r\nL’ENFANT AIMÉE OU JE JOUE À ÊTRE UNE FEMME MARIÉE, Belgium, 1971. (35 mins., 16mm)—POSTPONED\r\n\r\nThese three early Akerman films (spanning the decade of the 1970s), bring together different structures by which the filmmaker finds her own voice. What “Le 15/08” shares with “L’enfant aimé” is a sense of domestic space in which life is represented as a rhythmical process, with pulse, form and function of all the parts made visible. The voice-over in “Le 15/08,” presents a stream-of-consciousness portrait of a young Danish woman in Paris. She is there looking for work, in an apartment that is not her own. Time passes, and her thoughts are heard. But there is also judgment and taking issue with the woman’s own body, presented as if the locus of criticism lies outside herself, a trope that seems to emerge from the mirror sequence of “L’enfant aimé.” “Aujourd’hui dis-moi” features a set of interviews conducted by Akerman as she travels from door to door in Paris, knocking and being invited inside by a series of elderly, respectable-looking ladies. Over coffee and cakes, these women, all Jewish from Eastern Europe and survivors of the Holocaust, share their dread tales, amid stories of food and love and family life. \r\n\r\nFRIDAY, OCTOBER 7, 8pm\r\nHISTOIRES D’AMÉRIQUE (AMERICAN STORIES: FOOD, FAMILY AND PHILOSOPHY), Belgium/France, 1989. (92 mins., DCP). English.\r\n\r\nShot in New York, Akerman’s first English-language film “Histoires d’Amérique” conjures up an informal history of Jewish life over the past 100 years through a series of eyewitness accounts recreated by a group of largely unknown actors. Akerman explains, “Instead of learning my family\'s story directly from my parents, I had to turn to literature—[Isaac Bashevis] Singer. But his memories weren’t exactly mine, so I made up my own; this film is about memory, but an invented one.” The actors are all Jewish. Shot in a vacant lot in Brooklyn at night, they recite jokes and real-life stories that define what has survived and been transmitted from generation to generation. The trauma of the old world is never far from the new. Like the jesters or “badchen” who entertained at weddings in the old country, the actors move between comedy and intricate Talmudic references. “Histoires d’Amerique’s” ambivalence lies somewhere between Woody Allen’s “Broadway Danny Rose” and Samuel Beckett’s “Waiting for Godot.” As Akerman has said, “when history becomes impossible to bear, there is only one thing to do: send yourself up and laugh.” Nominated for the Golden Bear award, Berlin International Film Festival, 1989.\r\n\r\nMONDAY, OCTOBER 10, 7pm\r\nNEWS FROM HOME, France/Belgium/West Germany, 1976. (85 mins., 16mm). \r\n\r\nAkerman returned to New York in 1976, after having completed her original and audacious film “Jeanne Dielman\" in Europe. She was travelling back to a city of decay (not decadence) with letters her mother wrote to her when she was in New York in 1972. “News from Home” unfolds in long observational shots interspersed with the soundtrack of a woman’s voice reading and bringing family news from Brussels, describing trips to the seashore and worries for her daughter in New York. Who is addressing whom is no simple matter. Akerman allows us to see and hear what she sees and hears—tall buildings, diners, late-night bookstores, and an indelible final shot, looking back from the Staten Island Ferry as it pulls away from lower Manhattan’s skyline. Sounds might be in sync or not. “Akerman has described her murmuring voice-over of her mother’s letters as psalmody (the singing of psalms or sacred canticles in public worship), which evokes a prayerful effect, the mingling of longing, a provoking of guilt and the offer of love. The closing scenes of departure and voyage play without the presence of a voice. Such an absence perhaps allows for a new note of optimism—to proceed, one must depart.”—Adam Roberts, A Nos Amours, London\r\n\r\nMONDAY, OCTOBER 17, 7pm—POSTPONED\r\nJ’AI FAIM, J’AI FROID, France, 1984.

Marianne Lambert (67min.)\r\n\r\n“I Don’t Belong Anywhere” explores Chantal Akerman as a nomadic filmmaker and portrays Akerman in conversation with her collaborator, Claire Atherton, where she discusses the origins of her film language and charts her cinematic trajectory, one that never ceased to interrogate the meaning of her own existence. The film includes excerpts from many of Akerman’s 40-plus films made from 1968 to the time of her death in 2015.\r\n\r\nFRIDAY, JUNE 24, 7pm \r\nProgram introduction by writer, SARA JAFFE\r\n\r\nDIS-MOI (Tell Me), 1980. dir. Chantal Akerman (45 min.)\r\nDis-Moi  was commissioned for French TV and is the first film, after 10 years in filmmaking, in which Chantal Akerman—herself the daughter of an Auschwitz survivor—engages with the Holocaust through intimate discussions with three Jewish grandmothers, all of them survivors of the Shoah. Akerman conducts the interviews herself, bearing witness to stories told by these elderly women and how they have been cut off both from their pasts and themselves by the experience of such horror. \"And speak they do, movingly, affectingly, wonderfully. We learn as much in these few minutes as we should about the Shoah: yes, it was a terrible crime against humanity, that needs to be remembered and memorialized, but we also learn something elemental about life in the shtetl in Poland before the war (about bakery, tailoring, courtship, love), and so therefore the truth of what is lost. This is history as weft. The lineal facts may provide the warp, but without the weft we are unlikely to feel, because we all know what it is to sit beside a mother and hear the family history.” — Adam Roberts, The Huffington Post. French with new English Subtitles provided by A Nos Amours, London.\r\n\r\nLÀ-BAS (Over There), 2006. dir. Chantal Akerman (79 min.)\r\nLà-bas is one of Akerman’s most fragile and most powerful works in which she uses her own voice to personalize and narrate the visual images. For a month in Tel Aviv, Akerman points her lens outward through two large windows with blinds that filter the light of the exterior world. Apprehensive about a recent bombing, Akerman constructs a profound meditation on whether Israel is indeed the ‘promised land’ or merely a new form of exile. Akerman’s relationship with Israel is overwhelming and frustrating, a matter of love and hate. The vast untroubled waters have lapped these shores throughout human history. The sea is an image of freedom, or ease, of human concerns dwarfed. But as ever, it is back to the apartment, and the glimpse of a life outside, beyond the shutters. Winner of the Grand Prize at the Marseille International Documentary Festival and nominated for a French Cesar, in Là-bas Akerman, who was heavily influenced by structural  filmmakers like Michael Snow, “takes the aesthetic strategies of the minimalists and marries them to the humanist content that they suppressed. Fragile… and powerful.” — Amy Taubin, Film Comment. French and English with English Subtitles.\r\n\r\nSATURDAY, JULY 16, 7pm\r\nProgram introduction by dancer and choreographer, LINDA AUSTIN\r\n\r\nUN JOUR PINA M’A DEMANDE (One Day Pina Asked), 1983. dir. Chantal Akerman (61min.)\r\n\r\nBorn a decade apart, Chantal Akerman (1950–2015) and Pina Bausch (1940–2009) were two remarkable artists who redefined our cultural expectations. In theatrical dance works, Bausch took commonplace gestures and transformed them into extraordinary pageants, while Akerman choreographed wonderful cinematic compositions made of rhythmical everyday elements. In \"Un Jour Pina M’a Demandè,\" Chantal Akerman realized one of the greatest of all syntheses of dance and cinema. In her sublime 1983 film of Pina Bausch and her dancers, Akerman documents Bausch and her dance company for five weeks while they are on tour in Germany, Italy and France. The encounter is a meeting of sensibilities, a perfect combination of the filmmaker’s sage framing and the dancer’s flamboyant world-making.\r\n\r\nBausch was one of the most significant figures of modern dance and the pioneer of a unique style drawn from the German theatrical dance tradition known as \"tanztheater.\" Akerman films the performers with a poised camera in audacious compositions which emphasize the dances’ visual counterpoint and overlapping rhythms by a framing that’s as much an act of blocking out as of depicting. Unlike the idealized vantage of Wim Wender’s \"Pina\" (2011), \"Un Jour Pina M’a Demande“ reproduces the pull between meaning and its impasse that structures Bausch’s dances. Focused under Akerman’s lens, Bausch’s oeuvre resolves as a matter of the quotidian, pathologized, its order deranged not through an absence but an acceleration of some underlying logic: something, in other words, like the readymade subject of an Akerman film.” —Courtney Fiske, Artforum.\r\n\r\n\"Un Jour Pina M’a Demandè\" captures the grace of bodies in motion both onstage and behind it, with dressing rooms filled with lithe, sinewy men and women slicking back hair, adjusting ties, reapplying makeup. In an interview, Akerman commented, “At first, I had been dazzled, I only saw the beauty, the aestheticism. But in making a film on her, I understood that in fact she makes you take pleasure in her sadism through formal beauty. But she’s a great artist.” —Chantal Akerman.\r\n\r\nFRIDAY, JULY 29, 8pm\r\nCHANTAL AKERMAN\'S SHORT FILMS, 1968 – 1997\r\n\r\nThis hour and a half program is a series of up to ten short films by Chantal Akerman from her earliest film “Saute ma Ville” from 1968 to acclaimed and unknown films from 1971 up until 1997. The series brings together films which explore Akerman’s sexuality and life as a filmmaker such as “Le Chambre” (1972) and “J’ai Faim, J’ai Froid” (1984), along with “Rue Mallet Stevens” (1986) which introduces the music of cellist Sonia Wieder-Atherton and, in “Ecrire Contre L’oubli” (1991), Akerman engages with the plight of the tortured in El Salvador‘s civil war, an early film in her engagement with different geographies and human conflicts from the early 1990s until her death in 2015.

Marat Grinberg considers the questions of Jewishness and Holocaust representation in Akerman’s films, concentrating on two documentaries, “D’est” (1993) and “La-bas” (2006) and her fiction film, “Tomorrow We Move” (2004), in which she explores her Jewishness most explicitly. Situating Akerman’s work in the larger context of post-war European Holocaust cinema and such filmmakers as Andrei Tarkovsky, Grinberg foregrounds the issue of absence and the relationship between live action and documentary footage as paramount to understanding Akerman’s approach to her identity and the Holocaust. Luis Croquer takes as a point of departure his own curatorial work and his personal experience with non-linear notions of identity to address Akerman\'s resistance to labels and the hybridity of her approach to film. Through images and clips, Croquer prods the ghostly presence of architecture, and cities, in her work to try to unpack their relationship to place, emotion, memory, and to the body. Akerman’s contributions to film are discussed in relationship to filmmakers like Michelangelo Antonioni, Stanley Kubrick and again, Tarkovsky, as well as to the work of contemporary artists that are influenced, directly or indirectly, by experimental cinema. The conversation aims to address questions left unanswered by the artist and to ponder how Akerman\'s dispassionate but persistent questioning of identity and established narratives seems especially prescient today. \r\n\r\nLuis Croquer is the Deputy Director of Exhibitions, Collections and Programs at the Henry Art Gallery in Seattle. He served as the first Director of the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit (MOCAD) from 2008 to 2011. He previously held positions at El Museo del Barrio, the American Federation of Arts and the Drawing Center in New York. At the Henry he has overseen more than 40 exhibitions and curated many projects. His most recent shows include, “Paul McCarthy: White Snow Wood Sculptures” and “Franz Erhard Walther: The Body Draws,” a namesake publication is forthcoming. He has been the recipient of Fulbright, Hilla Rebay International and Warhol Foundation fellowships and has been a juror for many national and regional awards. Croquer was born in El Salvador, the son of a Venezuelan diplomat, he has lived in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas.\r\n\r\nMarat Grinberg is Associate Professor of Russian and Humanities at Reed College.

If Akerman was able to do so to such an extent it is because she had allowed herself — not without risks — to be open to the silenced voices that struggled to speak within her. They were the voices that have haunted the children of Holocaust survivors in the bubble of silence where their parents, to protect them — and protect themselves — have trapped them. The voices of unrequited desires, that suddenly explode in pop singing, joyous dancing, depressive rituals, uncharted travels — the discreet lament of women that nobody listens to as they are absorbed in their repetitive tasks — the unheard cry of the man dragged to his death behind a pick-up truck — the sighs of illegal immigrants absorbed by the desert or the urban jungle — the monotonous footsteps of people waiting for the train, or some food, on a cold night. “When I shoot, I turn myself into a sponge,” said Akerman; she was becoming porous, a conduit for these longings, these joys, these sorrows, that merged with hers.\r\n\r\nBérénice Reynaud is a French film critic, historian and theoretician who has a joint appointment in the School of Film/Video and School of Critical Studies at the California Institute of the Arts. Reynaud is the Film/ Video Co-curator at the Roy and Edna Disney CalArts Theatre (REDCAT) and she is a Program Consultant for The Viennale Film Festival and a Delegate for the San Sebastian International Film Festival. Reynaud was the main organizer of the Chantal Akerman film series “Contre l’oubli / Against Oblivion“ that took place across six Los Angeles cultural institutions (Spring 2016) and she edited the \"Senses of Cinema\" dossier “Chantal Akerman: La Passion de l’Intime /An Intimate Passion” (December 2015). She is the author of \"Nouvelles Chines, nouveaux cinémas\" (Paris, 1999) and \"A City of Sadness\" on Hou Hsiao-hsien’s film (London, 2002).

THE FILMS OF CHANTAL AKERMAN 1968-2015\r\n<br><br>\r\nLOOKING, REALLY LOOKING! The Films of Chantal Akerman 1968-2015 is a film and performative program which surveys the work of the Belgian/French filmmaker Chantal Akerman and places it within a conceptual, thematic and historical context at the intersection of film and contemporary art. Seen in historical and avant-garde circles from the US and Western Europe to the Middle East and South America, Akerman’s films move across genres from the documentary/essay to the musical and multi-media installations and are often referred to as feminist, queer or Jewish. Akerman (1950-2015) presents us with complexities and doubts in an oeuvre that spans nearly fifty years and revolves around her family history, identity, memory and displacement, often portrayed in lengthy observations within the modest aesthetics of everyday life. \r\n<br><br>\r\nAkerman created 40-plus films most of which have never before been seen in Portland and rarely on the west coast, nor her work deeply discussed. LOOKING, REALLY LOOKING! is not a chronological survey but rather an ideas-based approach which brings each chapter of the program into a series of performative conversations and events in Zena Zezza’s Dialogues series. Akerman\'s seminal first film \"Saute ma Ville\" (1968), influenced by Jean-Luc Godard’s \"Pierrot Le Fou\" (1965), will be shown alongside \"Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles,\" a film which chronicles a woman’s domestic routines and which Richard Brody of The New Yorker called “one of the most original and audacious films in the history of cinema.” \r\n<br><br>\r\nAkerman’s documentary/essay films led her to diverse landscapes and geo-political contexts from Mexico to the Middle East and American South in films including \"De l’autre cote\" (From the Other Side), \"NOW\" and \"Sud\" (South) influenced by the literature of William Faulkner and James Baldwin. Her production moves from silent films to re-imagined musicals and to portraits of artists including Franz Schubert, Pina Bausch and cellist Sonia Wieder-Atherton. In New York in the early 1970s, Akerman intensely watched avant-garde filmmakers Michael Snow, Jonas Mekas, Yvonne Rainer and Andy Warhol, and her earliest films were influenced by Jean-Luc Godard. Directors like Gus van Sant, Todd Haynes, Sally Potter and Michael Haneke have credited her as a major influence. J. Hoberman, film critic and contributor to Artforum, called Akerman “arguably the most important European film director of her generation.” \r\n<br><br>\r\nChantal Akerman\'s work has been shown in major museums from the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis to Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; in major international film festivals from Toronto to Vienna; in and in international exhibitions including Documenta X and XI in 1997 and 2002 and the 49th and 56th Venice Biennales in 2001 and 2015.  She won special mention in the Nuremberg International Human Rights Film Festival Prize (2001); was nominated for the Best Documentary Film in the Cesar Awards, France (2007); and won the Bielfeld Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau Film Award and the EDA (Excellent Dynamic Activism) Female Focus Award (in memoriam) from the Alliance of Women Film Journalists (2015). \r\n<br><br>\r\nAkerman\'s films have recently been the subject of surveys presented by the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York and in a Los Angeles-wide survey which took place at six institutions including Redcat, LA Film Forum and Fahrenheit. Presciently, Nos Amours, a London-based film collective, undertook a two-year survey of Akerman’s films at London’s Institute of Contemporary Art in 2013-2015 and presented seven installation works at Ambica3 Gallery in early 2016. \r\n<br><br>\r\nLOOKING, REALLY LOOKING! is curated by Sandra Percival, Zena Zezza, and produced in collaboration with Morgen Ruff, Programmer, Northwest Film Center, Portland Art Museum.\r\n<br><br><br>\r\n\r\nFILM SCREENINGS (see Film Screenings for dates, details and descriptions)\r\n<br><br>\r\nLOOKING, REALLY LOOKING!

Similarities echo in “No Home Movie” which Akerman filmed in the final months of her mother’s life. “My Mother Laughs” is presented as an intimate portrayal of the time spent between Chantal and her mother, Nelly.  Grace Carter, Paige McKinney and Ron Mason Gassaway interpret Chantal’s disarmingly direct words in the spirit of her relationship to her mother, her self, her films and how her mother and her own life were intricately entwined and over-shadowed by the Holocaust (Nelly was a survivor of Auschwitz). Grace Carter, as performer, reads as a conduit for Chantal’s “voice,” honoring her boldness, her rawness, her quietude, her wry observations and her deep well of reverence for her mother. \r\n\r\nTickets: $15 general, $10 artists and seniors, $5 students. \r\nDonate what you can.

Grace’s work focuses on the visceral and immersive qualities of live performance and incorporates a multidisciplinary and contemporary aesthetic to her work.\r\n\r\nPaige McKinney is an actor, director, choreographer and dancer whose focus is on new live performance works, and whose work synthesizes movement, the voice, and unexplored bodies of text.\r\n\r\nRon Mason Gassaway is a songwriter and composer, live performer and video artist who works with directors, writers and companies. He is a founding member of the provocative improvisational group Party Killer.\r\n\r\n“My Mother Laughs,” first performed in English at The Kitchen in New York in 2013, as part of the exhibition “Chantal Akerman: Maniac Shadows, is the second of Akerman’s written and performed works; her first was a reading of \"A Family in Brussels\" at Dia:Beacon in 2001. These are the only known reading performances by Akerman in the US. Zena Zezza’s production of “My Mother Laughs” continues the legacy of Akerman’s text and performance-based work.\r\n\r\nPostscript\r\n“My Mother Laughs” is an excerpt from Chantal Akerman’s confessional book, “Ma mere rit,” published by Mercure de France in 2013 to rave reviews. Akerman presented a dramatic reading of “My Mother Laughs” at The Kitchen in New York on April 11, 2013, as part of the exhibition “Chantal Akerman: Maniac Shadows.” Akerman’s film “No Home Movie” was released in 2015.

She looks right, left, right, then turns to the left and begins walking. At least for the moment, this is her search, her journey. The first audio we hear, a conversation between Akerman and her mother, reinforces Akerman’s centrality in the film to come, suggests that we might be entering a work of autobiography. \r\n<br><br>\r\nBut something shifts. Akerman ascends flights of stairs to sit in the dining rooms of older women, none of whom she seems to know, or know well. Though she is often in the frame, she rarely speaks. She has imprinted herself but ceded her centrality. The self is the jumping-off point, not the ultimate object of investigation. I’m implicated, the film tells us, but this is not my story. The self mobilizes the narrative without laying claim to it. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe other film being shown tonight, \"Là-Bas,\" bears more markers of conventional autobiography—the text is diaristic, overtly personal—yet the camera is always looking outward. Much of the film is shot out the window, through the narrow channel between the shades. Her perspective both saturates the frame and limits its scope—as any subjective viewpoint—any viewpoint—must do. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThese films thus produce the self as both an absence and a presence, which manifests a compelling tension. This is not the manipulative tension of a talking-head documentary, where there’s a smugness or coyness to the author’s removal. It’s the implicit tension of being a person in the world. \r\n<br><br>\r\nIn an interview in the \"Los Angeles Review of Books,\" Maggie Nelson was asked about the term “autotheory,” which she used to describe her book \"The Argonauts.\" Nelson says, ““I’m always looking for terms that are not ‘memoir’ to describe autobiographical writing that exceeds the boundaries of the ‘personal.’” There are certainly great divergences between Nelson’s project—which uses the personal as the starting point for broader critical and theoretical investigations—and Akerman’s, which “exceeds the personal” through a kind of self-effacement. Still, I think both share in a recognition that in any artistic or scholarly endeavor we begin, necessarily, with our own individual experiences, our own bodies. The act of communication, or art, or love is moving from that point ever outward.\r\n',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(228,1,'2017-08-30 11:10:13','2021-05-26 20:46:10',10,'Dialogues',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'dialogues',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Chantal Akerman: Artist Project Season',_binary 'Dialogues is Zena\'s series of performative conversations on the ideas and influences within Chantal Akerman\'s work, bringing together theory, scholarship and artists\' practices with LOOKING, REALLY LOOKING!

Marat Grinberg considers the questions of Jewishness and Holocaust representation in Akerman’s films, concentrating on two documentaries, “D’est” (1993) and “La-bas” (2006) and her fiction film, “Tomorrow We Move” (2004), in which she explores her Jewishness most explicitly. Situating Akerman’s work in the larger context of post-war European Holocaust cinema and such filmmakers as Andrei Tarkovsky, Grinberg foregrounds the issue of absence and the relationship between live action and documentary footage as paramount to understanding Akerman’s approach to her identity and the Holocaust. Luis Croquer takes as a point of departure his own curatorial work and his personal experience with non-linear notions of identity to address Akerman\'s resistance to labels and the hybridity of her approach to film. Through images and clips, Croquer prods the ghostly presence of architecture, and cities, in her work to try to unpack their relationship to place, emotion, memory, and to the body. Akerman’s contributions to film are discussed in relationship to filmmakers like Michelangelo Antonioni, Stanley Kubrick and again, Tarkovsky, as well as to the work of contemporary artists that are influenced, directly or indirectly, by experimental cinema. The conversation aims to address questions left unanswered by the artist and to ponder how Akerman\'s dispassionate but persistent questioning of identity and established narratives seems especially prescient today. \r\n<br><br>\r\nLuis Croquer is the Deputy Director of Exhibitions, Collections and Programs at the Henry Art Gallery in Seattle. He served as the first Director of the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit (MOCAD) from 2008 to 2011.

If Akerman was able to do so to such an extent it is because she had allowed herself — not without risks — to be open to the silenced voices that struggled to speak within her. They were the voices that have haunted the children of Holocaust survivors in the bubble of silence where their parents, to protect them — and protect themselves — have trapped them. The voices of unrequited desires, that suddenly explode in pop singing, joyous dancing, depressive rituals, uncharted travels — the discreet lament of women that nobody listens to as they are absorbed in their repetitive tasks — the unheard cry of the man dragged to his death behind a pick-up truck — the sighs of illegal immigrants absorbed by the desert or the urban jungle — the monotonous footsteps of people waiting for the train, or some food, on a cold night. “When I shoot, I turn myself into a sponge,” said Akerman; she was becoming porous, a conduit for these longings, these joys, these sorrows, that merged with hers.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBérénice Reynaud is a French film critic, historian and theoretician who has a joint appointment in the School of Film/Video and School of Critical Studies at the California Institute of the Arts.

Grace Carter, as performer, reads as a conduit for Chantal’s “voice,” honoring her boldness, her rawness, her quietude, her wry observations and her deep well of reverence for her mother. \r\n<br><br>\r\nTickets: $15 general, $10 artists and seniors, $5 students. <br>\r\nDonate what you can. No one turned away at the door. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThis performance is conceived and acted by Portland-based Grace Carter with co-director Paige McKinney and sound by Ron Mason Gassaway. \r\n<br><br>\r\nGrace Carter is a theatre artist who has been producing, directing and performing critically acclaimed theatre productions for the past 17 years in Portland. Grace’s work focuses on the visceral and immersive qualities of live performance and incorporates a multidisciplinary and contemporary aesthetic to her work.\r\n<br><br>\r\nPaige McKinney is an actor, director, choreographer and dancer whose focus is on new live performance works, and whose work synthesizes movement, the voice, and unexplored bodies of text.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRon Mason Gassaway is a songwriter and composer, live performer and video artist who works with directors, writers and companies. He is a founding member of the provocative improvisational group Party Killer.\r\n<br><br>\r\n“My Mother Laughs,” first performed in English at The Kitchen in New York in 2013, as part of the exhibition “Chantal Akerman: Maniac Shadows, is the second of Akerman’s written and performed works; her first was a reading of \"A Family in Brussels\" at Dia:Beacon in 2001. These are the only known reading performances by Akerman in the US. Zena Zezza’s production of “My Mother Laughs” continues the legacy of Akerman’s text and performance-based work.\r\n<br><br>\r\nPostscript<br>\r\n“My Mother Laughs” is an excerpt from Chantal Akerman’s confessional book, “Ma mere rit,” published by Mercure de France in 2013 to rave reviews. Akerman presented a dramatic reading of “My Mother Laughs” at The Kitchen in New York on April 11, 2013, as part of the exhibition “Chantal Akerman: Maniac Shadows.” Akerman’s film “No Home Movie” was released in 2015.  Natalie Liebel Akerman died at the age of 86 in April, 2014. Chantal died, October 5, 2015. \r\n<br><br>\r\nLocation: PNCA Mediatheque<br>\r\n511 NW Broadway',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(234,1,'2017-08-30 11:13:38','2021-05-28 16:22:27',7,'.Tickets',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'tickets',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '\r\n																								Free Admission for Zena Members',_binary '\r\n																								For year-round free admission to all film screenings and \"Dialogues\" events with priority seating —<br><br><div>\r\nJOIN NOW at SUPPORT\r\n<br><br><br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<form action=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr\" method=\"post\" target=\"_top\">\r\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"cmd\" value=\"_s-xclick\">\r\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"hosted_button_id\" value=\"3PCN5UGQJSVZJ\">\r\n<table>\r\n<tbody><tr><td><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"on0\" value=\"Tickets\">Tickets</td></tr><tr><td><select name=\"os0\">\r\n	<option value=\"Dialogues May 14: General\">Dialogues May 14: General $7.00 USD</option>\r\n	<option value=\"Dialogues May 14: Seniors, Artists\">Dialogues May 14: Seniors, Artists $5.00 USD</option>\r\n	<option value=\"Dialogues May 14: Students\">Dialogues May 14: Students $3.00 USD</option>\r\n	<option value=\"Ma Mere Rit May 18: General\">Ma Mere Rit May 18: General $15.00 USD</option>\r\n	<option value=\"Ma Mere Rit May 18: Seniors, Artists\">Ma Mere Rit May 18: Seniors, Artists $10.00 USD</option>\r\n	<option value=\"Ma Mere Rit May 18: Students\">Ma Mere Rit May 18: Students $5.00 USD</option>\r\n</select> </td></tr>\r\n</tbody></table>\r\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"currency_code\" value=\"USD\">\r\n<input type=\"image\" src=\"https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_buynowCC_LG.gif\" border=\"0\" name=\"submit\" alt=\"PayPal - The safer, easier way to pay online!\">\r\n<img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/scr/pixel.gif\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\">\r\n</form>\r\n<br><br><br>\r\n\r\nGive what you can, no one will be turned away.</div>',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(235,1,'2017-08-30 11:36:50','2021-05-26 16:57:34',1,'No Idolatry and Losing Everything That Made You a Slave',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'no-idolatry-and-losing-everything',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Chantal Akerman &amp; Elisabeth Lebovici',_binary 'Chantal Akerman has addressed themes like otherness and incarceration, starting with her own background and that of her mother, a survivor of the Nazi camps. Otherness is a non-conformity Akerman lives, as a woman and a Jew. Is it possible to bring out the fact that the Other, for itself, is completely Subject? The extraordinary filmography of the artist, who has always called herself directly into play, brilliantly resolves this issue. Elisabeth Lebovici met the artist to talk about these themes and to reinterpret some of her past and recent works.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nELISABETH LEBOVICI: If one wants to begin with a loaded introductory statement about Chantal Akerman, one should definitely talk about borders, frontiers, limits, the other side and the side of the Other. These notions are also there in the way you deal with your work, your craft, your profession: are you on the side of experimental filmmaking, or in the history of mainstream narrative cinema? The side of cinema or that of art? Or all of the above? That would be my first question, since you were one of the most prominent filmmakers to “cross over” in the mid-1990s. What do you feel about this crossover towards making art?\r\n<br><br>\r\nCHANTAL AKERMAN: My history with installation was probably not an accident, though it appeared as if it were: it would never have happened without Kathy Halbreich, then the head of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, who asked me if I would do something in a museum context. That was probably in the early 1990s, when the curator Michael Tarantino had repeatedly observed that my films were a major influence on contemporary artists. You know I didn’t learn about art. I ran away from school when I was 15. I was never really exposed to exhibitions before the early 1970s, the best years to me, when I found myself in a small group of the New York avant-garde, with Babette Mangolte, Jonas Mekas, Michael Snow, Annette Michelson, whom I respect so much...<br>\r\nAnyway, it happened because of Kathy Halbreich. At the time I was doing “Night and Day”. She said she was interested in history, I said I was equally interested in the polyphony of languages. I had been wanting to go towards Eastern Europe for twenty years – and it was just opening up – in order to work with the different Slavic languages, which are distinct but sound quite similar. I wanted to do a work about changes in voices and languages, a project that then developed on its own into a totally different form: while the texture of the soundtrack is very important in “D’Est”, there is not one word in the film. At the beginning I wanted her to produce such a film; I didn’t care about the art thing. In the meantime I found money and did “From the East”. One year later, maybe two, I was told that funds had been raised for an installation, and I began playing around with the film material I had already gathered. It happened when I had three reels of the film, and I was playing with time. I saw four minutes that worked together in these three reels. Why? I don’t know. There were four minutes. And then we found eight times four minutes, 24 screens as in 24 images per second; that is how the installation found its own agency. I wrote the last, 25th part as something more visually abstract, but with a very intimate text that evoked something more like a memorial. It also deals with limits, death, the camps. My fixation with borders comes from the camps. When you touch on that limit – and I touched it very closely through my mother, who was in the camps but was never able to talk through her anxiety – this border takes on the source of the anxiety, it becomes an “anxious Abject”. In “From the Other Side”, for instance, I show the wall to my mother and ask her what it brings to mind, and she says: “you know what”. When it is internalized, experience is given without speaking, transmitted as a spectral presence; you cannot separate yourself from it. In the film “Down There” the notion of the ‘Other’ takes on more complexity, because it’s the same side, but the other side, the inside too. I try to connect to that internalization, because it’s something you have to live with, that lives there before you. But it’s hard. The reason is that I touched another limit, which is myself. \r\n<br><br>\r\nEL: Talking about borders and confinement, home and breaking loose... Isn’t that what home is about? When one looks at Jeanne Dielman in her kitchen, or when one finds oneself immersed in your last installation, shot in and from your home, the camera is the operator to feel confinement, beyond the visual depiction of space...\r\n<br><br>\r\nCA: The jail is very, very present in all of my work, in “”La Captive as well as “Jeanne Dielman”... sometimes not so frontally. Now when you enter America, you have to put all of your fingers in ink, it’s like entering a big jail. Do you know that you cannot smoke anymore in Central Park? New York is not like it was in the 1970s, everything was happening then, now it’s much more about money. France is terrible, you feel no energy at all. In America you still have energy, but mostly for bling. \r\n<br><br>\r\nEL: For you, where does this notion of the other side come from?\r\n<br><br>\r\nCA: From Emmanuel Lévinas. He is part of my culture. For two years I attended his classes at ENIO (École Normale Israelite Orientale): he would always have a young person, a boy or a girl, read an excerpt from the Bible, standing in front of him, a minuscule, fragile figure surrounded by tons of books, and then he would get started and go far, far away... I often quote his statement: “When you see the face of the Other, you already hear the words ‘Thou shalt not kill’”. If only he had been heard. How could I not hear it! The other face is also the face of the viewer, I have always thought: I have an understanding that making films is very much about frontality, about facing off.\r\n<br><br>\r\nEL: The notion of the Other has also been reassessed by feminism, first by Simone de Beauvoir when she observed that “he is the Subject, he is the Absolute – she is the Other” – that is, the non-subject, the non-person, in short, the mere body. Being on the other side, then, is also being on the side of the Other, reclaiming the self.\r\n<br><br>\r\nCA: It was such an emancipating time, between 1968 and 1973. I felt free to make “Je, tu, il, elle”, which was then an incredible provocation. I shot the film in one week, and at first I tried to have another woman play my part, a substitute for my own body. <br>\r\nBut I soon realized it had to be me, my body. Just as in “Saute ma ville”, which I now think is my queerest movie. “Saute ma ville”, to me, is the opposite of “Jeanne Dielman”: the story of a girl who talks back to her mother, who explodes the norms confining women to womanly tasks, who breaks everything in kitchen and does everything in a crooked way – and yet, for all that, it is a love story: the film is dedicated. \r\n<br><br>\r\nEL: I love the way you deal with your own body – defying its sense of gravity as well as its respectability – in “Je, tu, il, elle”, for instance, where after your long journey you finally enter “elle”’s apartment, and the first thing you do is to trip on the carpet and fall down...\r\n<br><br>\r\nCA: I’m a female Charlie Chaplin, I could have made slapstick comedy. I’m thinking more and more about acting again, in my films. My body in a movie is very important, it says something by itself, it has the weight of the Real. I can’t have actresses playing my clumsiness. It seems impossible for me to be in a restaurant without knocking something over: my gestures are too large, or I’m pursuing my thoughts and get startled. You’re out of convention with your own body, with your own way of moving. When I was a child, and being raised in such a conventional bourgeois high school, I thought it was a question of class, I attributed my non-conformity to the fact that I was a Jew. I didn’t attribute it to gender then, but I realized later that the other girls were already built to fit what a young woman was raised to become, in conformity with their future as women in a normative society: my parents didn’t have the time, they didn’t succeed. When I was fifteen and ate too much chocolate, and put on weight, my father suddenly realized that I had to get skinnier to be sold to a man; he wanted me to wear dresses but it didn’t work. When I was 18 I rushed to Paris, then I rushed to New York, to get even farther away. The only person I didn’t succeed in making that split with was my mother, because she was a camp survivor, and I was born when she was older, in 1950. I still think of myself as an old child...\r\n<br><br>\r\nEL: On the other side of gender difference?\r\n<br><br>\r\nCA: Well, for several months I joined the feminist faction of “Psych et Po”, with Antoinette Fouque, which made it normal to expose yourself. But that’s another story...\r\n<br><br>\r\nEL: But you were recruited to film a case history of Freud: was it Anna O?\r\n<br><br>\r\nCA: No, it was “The Psychogenesis of a Case of Homosexuality in a Woman”. I was just asked to help, not to do the film myself, and was soon pulled away.\r\n<br><br>\r\nEL: Psychoanalysis is part of your life, but could you film Freud?\r\n<br><br>\r\nCA: I remember that Dora was fascinating. But there are so many people who have thought about psychoanalysis after Freud. For instance, there is this theory of André Green, in “Narcissisme de Vie, Narcissisme de Mort” (1983), about the complex of the dead mother, where he writes about the ways maternal depression abandons the child and his or her craving for being held, comforted, accompanied. \r\n<br><br>\r\nEL: Taking sides with the mother?\r\n<br><br>\r\nCA: At the beginning I thought that since she didn’t have any voice, I would be speaking for her, but it turned out not to be so true, it was just my way of explaining things. What is true is that I was speaking for all women: “Jeanne Dielman, 23, Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles”: what woman didn’t feel something about that? When “Je, tu, il, elle” was released my telephone was bombarded with calls from people who identified with what I was showing. When a figure appears that has rarely been exposed, it indicates that something was probably boiling.\r\n<br><br>\r\nEL: I have always been struck by the fact that in “Je, tu, il, elle” the performance of sex is there without its reality, as in the scene between two naked women. Not only do you deconstruct heteronormative sex, but in many of your films you also contradict the notion of sexual pleasure as a climax for the psyche. This very much goes with Leo Bersani’s notion of the “Freudian Body”, which disengages the equation between release of sexual energy and jouissance.\r\n<br><br>\r\nCA: In “Jeanne Dielman” I showed that not having pleasure was her last freedom. If Jeanne had found pleasure in having sex with her client, she would have been surrendering to the men with whom she was working. I had endless discussions with Delphine Seyrig, who said that once you had pleasure, you would want to repeat it... I was only 24 and she was over forty, she was “the subject supposed to know” (Lacan), but I struggled to make her believe me: fighting against pleasure is Jeanne’s resistance, it is her way of existing, her jouissance in relation to the obligation of pleasure, which was the doxa at the time I shot the film. From the 1970s on another obligation had come for women, taking the place of choice and freedom. In “Les rendez-vous d’Anna”, when the main character (played by Aurore Clément) is in Germany, she tells the guy she’s not in love with him, that he has to put his clothes back on. Again, this is resistance to such pleasure obligation. \r\n<br><br>\r\nEL: Your body returns in the installation “Maniac Summer”, 2009, which I saw at Marian Goodman in Paris (2010); but not as a prevalent image, not as the center. It is night, and a ghostly image appears on just one of the three screens of the installation, doing things, office work, at the computer, on the phone. Then, on the two other screens placed on two other walls, we see a park with children, and a courtyard viewed from a Parisian apartment...\r\n<br><br>\r\nCA: I did this first part at random, just putting the camera beside me and forgetting about it, doing whatever I was doing. Then I moved the camera to my window, shot a little bit outside, organizing a landscape that was almost unrecognizable. It was more of an orphan film, without subject, object, author... “Maniac Summer” is very much about the other side of the figure, about abstraction. I had heard someone talking about Hiroshima, and it had made a great impression. The intense radiation of the blast left afterimages on walls, shadows of the bodies of people who were standing there, in the instant before they fell. I found the idea of these traces of death very moving, and tried to go forward with that idea in video, which was complicated as a medium for this kind of transformation: when the image falls, what stays on the walls afterwards? It falls into abstraction. Hiroshima is the landmark for the second half of the 20th century. I was born in 1950, this is my time. There are still things to be done about that century. As for the new century, I think we still don’t understand what is going on, at least for the moment. Did you read Jean-Claude Milner’s “Les penchants criminels de l’Europe démocratique”? It’s an extraordinary book, using the texts of Benjamin and Gershom Sholem, and trying to demonstrate how for Modern Europe the name “Jew” was thought of as a problem to solve. Milner explains that beyond all discourse, Europe would not have constructed its unification without the death of the Jews, without the extermination camps. \r\n<br><br>\r\nEL: Your present, however, is the 21st century: you are doing a retrospective at MuHKA, in Antwerp, and then there is “La folie Almayer”, your latest feature film, based on a novel by Joseph Conrad.\r\n<br><br>\r\nCA: Not exactly. There is one chapter at the end of the novel that broke my heart, when the girl, the female protagonist, is running away. I read that chapter, and that same night I saw “Tabu” by Murnau and it clicked, you see. That’s why I decided to do the film, thanks to one chapter of “Almayer’s Folly” and “Tabu”, because of the simplicity of that film, where Murnau was able to say such emotional things with almost nothing. My film is about the relationship of a father and his daughter. The father goes mad because he loses her. He is a very weak character, and I saw that as a challenge. My cousin in Toronto told me that in America they would never accept a weak man as the main character, so in a way it is also about gender definitions. \r\n<br><br>\r\nEL: You live in New York, you have a job at CUNY. What are you teaching?\r\n<br><br>\r\nCA: I’m not teaching, I’m helping graduate students with their thesis projects, which consist in making films. I push them to improve their scripts, to improve their work with actors and sets, so in a way I’m like a good producer, one who interferes a lot. I enjoy doing it and I’m very moved when suddenly some kind of clarity emerges. But there’s a lot of ignorance of cinema. When I ask “did you see All About Eve?”, many of the students have no idea who Mankiewicz was. One of the students wanted to make a film about a band, which is an iconic theme in America, so I told him he had to see “The Chronicle of Anna Magdalena Bach” by Straub-Huillet, which would show him how to shoot a band. That’s what I’m fighting against. Did you know that the school where I’m teaching is the one that gave Hannah Arendt a position after she fled from Europe? When Arendt came to America, there was a quota at Harvard regarding the number of Jews who could attend the university or be part of its faculty. Such quotas were abolished only in the 1960s. So all the Jews went to CUNY and donated money there, as well. That’s how I got the job. I always end up talking about what happened when the Jews fled from Egypt: it took them forty years – or three generations, in those days – to forget all the signs of slavery. Forty years, the space for oblivion, in order to be released from that bondage and to enter Israel. That’s why I think Pessah, or Exodus, is one of the most important books about slavery. Many countries in Africa didn’t get that time of forgetting, and the people who came out of the camps in Europe didn’t have such time either. If I put myself into a kind of prisoner situation, it is because my mother gave that to me. She didn’t have the forty years, either. That’s why the Genesis is the most important book in the world: because of the Exodus, because of idolatry, too. For me the crucial issues are: no idolatry and losing everything that made you a slave.\r\n<br><br>\r\nEL: What is your next project?\r\n<br><br>\r\nCA: I have a gap in my hearing ability. High notes are getting a bit imprecise. I would like to make a film that describes all the effects of this. High pitches are the ones that help us to precisely locate sound sources. I would like to write about it. Blindness is very romantic, it already has its place in literature, in the great myths, first and foremost that of Oedipus, of course. This is not true of deafness. I would like to underline the effects of this impairment.\r\n<br><br>\r\nMOUSSE MAGAZINE, Issue #31, November, 2011',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(236,1,'2017-08-30 11:37:18','2021-05-26 16:58:16',2,'These Shoes Are Made for Walking',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'these-shoes-are-made-for-walking',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Bérenice Reynaud',_binary 'Tap-tap-tap... Preceded by the clicking of her high heels, a young woman (Sylvie Testud) walks through the Place Vendôme in Paris, the camera following her in one unbroken shot until she reaches her car. A young man (Stanislas Mehrar) follows her, gets into his own car, and continues tailing her.&nbsp;<br><br>\r\nIn Marcel Proust\'s “À la Recherche du temps perdu” the young woman was Albertine and the man was Marcel. For “La Captive” (1999), her latest narrative feature to-date, Chantal Akerman, adapting “À la Recherche\'s” fifth volume, calls her Ariane. While much has been written about Proust\'s driver/companion Albert, who might be hidden behind the oddly feminine name of Albertine, Ariane is a name without masculine equivalent: in Greek mythology she was the daughter of Minos and Pasiphae who fell in love with Theseus and gave him a magic ball of twine to find his way in the labyrinth.(1) In ARiANE, one finds five letters of AkERmAN. From Proust to Albert to Albertine to, finally, Ariane and Akerman, there is a vertiginous interplay of sliding equivalences, of masks that simultaneously frame, hide and reveal some secret. In the film Ariane\'s partner, lover, captor and tormentor is named Simon, preserving the narrator\'s Jewishness, as well as alluding to Albertine\'s family name: Simonet.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn “La Captive”, updated to contemporary times, Simon lives a comfortable existence of ‘homme de lettres’ in a large bourgeois apartment that he shares with his grandmother and a housekeeper, Françoise,(2) and in which he keeps a young woman of unclear social status. Plagued by allergies and asthma, Simon is unable to accompany Ariane when she goes out, however, suspecting her of loving women, spies on her and relentlessly questions her to find out if she is \'lying\' to him. What unsettles him, ultimately, is the enigma of femininity. What is a woman? And which mystery is hidden when two women are together? Proust explores the masculine side of this question, probably transposing his own anxieties - what hidden pleasures could his (male) lover find with a woman? Conversely, in most of her films, especially those with a (semi)autobiographic resonance (“Je tu il elle, Les Rendez-vous d\'Anna”, “Portrait d\'une jeune fille de la fin des années 60 à Bruxelles”),(3) Akerman portrays women who desire both men and women, developing, however, a more intimate bond with the latter. For a female director the challenge posed by an adaptation of the Proustian text is that Marcel is constructed as the subject of desire - who acts upon it, obsesses about it, suffers from it - and Albertine is its unfathomable object. While both Sylvie Testud\'s outstanding performance and Akerman\'s peerless direction give Ariane a complex subjectivity and agency, what she does off-screen and what she thinks remain a mystery. Is it because the effects of female authorship are not powerful enough to dispel the \'active/passive heterosexual division of labour\' uncovered at the core of film narrative by Laura Mulvey: \'woman as image, man as the bearer of the look\'?(4) Or is a more interesting (transgressive) structure at work here: a woman attempting to look at another woman who loves women through the eyes of a man who tortures himself by trying to understand female homosexuality from the inside? Threatened by the contiguity/continuity between two female bodies that the homosexual bond entails, the boundary between two individuals can nevertheless be restored by the introduction of a third term, intervening from the other side of the gender line.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn “Portrait d\'une jeune fille de la fin des années 60 à Bruxelles” (1993), Akerman lays this structure bare by turning the main protagonist (the subject of desire) into a rather innocent, albeit passionate, teenage girl, Michèle (Circé), with a hopeless crush on her \'best friend\' at school. As Danielle\'s confidante she is an accomplice, the unwitting witness of the latter\'s awkward search for a \'dream man\'. Michèle escapes her predicament by cutting out of school, meeting Paul, a handsome and sensitive deserter, having sex with him, and then handing him on to Danielle:\r\n<br><br>\r\n- You\'ll meet him on my behalf. Then you\'ll tell me what happens. No, you won\'t tell me anything.<br> \r\n- You know I always tell you everything. <br>\r\n- Sometimes, I would prefer for you not to tell me everything. Go: he\'s going to be the man of your life ... After that, my mind will be at rest. But you musn\'t tell me anything from now on. I should no longer observe your quest.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIf not knowing is a torture for Simon, knowing is no less painful for Michèle. Those are the two reverse sides of the same predicament: there is something to know. The beloved woman does not want you the way you want her - she wants somebody else, of another gender. The subject is reduced to being the witness/non-witness of a coupling that keeps being concealed from his/her gaze, like a half-forgotten primal scene in which the forbidden body of the mother was glimpsed as \'belonging\' to someone else.\r\n<br><br>\r\nTap-tap-tap. Ariane climbs a staircase at the end of a cul-de-sac where she has parked her car. Mesmerised by the sound, Simon follows her on silent, efficient soles. The young woman disappears and Simon is now guided by the clicking of the invisible high heels. In the labyrinth of the city, where every street corner may hide a deception, every grove shelter a forbidden embrace, every smile conceal a treacherous seduction, the tap-tap-tap is the only \'ball of twine\' that the despondent and jealous lover can grasp. It complicates the fort-da game(5) that Simon plays with Ariane, redoubling the original visual dilemma (now you see her, now she\'s gone) into its aural version (now you hear her, now you don\'t). If you don\'t hear her, maybe she\'s behind you, barefoot, or she\'s in bed, asleep and waiting to be ravished with her eyes closed as in a Romantic painting. Yet, if you hear something, maybe it\'s not her but another woman wearing similar high heels (cosi fan tutte)(6) for there are hundreds, thousands of women in heels in the maze of streets, hidden staircases, public parks, hotels, restaurants, theatres and back alleys of Paris. When Simon starts following Ariane, the tap-tap-tap is the sign, both alluring and reassuring, of the young woman\'s presence. As the narration unfolds Simon is increasingly confronted to the multiplicity of high heels. The clicking of heels thus becomes the vertiginous signifier of an overflowing femininity. Julia Kristeva reminds us that, for Proust, Albertine has no fixed identity but always appears as a \'plural\' being, a \'multi-headed goddess\'. \'A woman could not be individuated. A petal in a bunch of flowers, a seagull in a flock of birds, or a mere reflection, detail, indistinct and interchangeable feature. [A] woman/women is always in an undifferentiated plural; she goes in group or bevy...\'.(7)\r\n<br><br>\r\nOne night Simon is looking for Ariane, who has left earlier wearing a white scarf. Every woman met in the shadows, attracting his attention through the clicking of her heels, seems to be wearing a similar scarf - offering herself to his gaze, or talking to him, or passing unnoticed behind him, or followed by him, half-surprised, half-frightened, in a dark staircase. Unable to fully possess the woman, Simon is reduced to grab pieces of femininity through visual or aural signs that turn out to be lures. Since more than one woman can wear high heels or white scarves, there is no way to distinguish one from the other and the protagonist is constantly mistaking the shadow for the prey.\r\n<br><br>\r\nA sign of multiple femininity, the clicking of the heels, however, awakens in the subject the dream of a unified signifier. To the child in bed, waiting for his/her mother\'s goodnight kiss, the tap-tap-tap signifies her arrival and then her cruel departure. It is also a bridge between absence and presence. The woman may be unseen but the sound of her footsteps reveals her proximity. She is not, however, motionless but walking - either in your direction (you\'re going to see her, embrace her soon) or away from you, or even passing you by. Here is the paradox: a woman who walks resists ultimate fetishisation for she is in constant motion; yet the shoes she wears are among the most coded objects of male sexual fetishism. One of the many subversions offered by Akerman\'s filmic text is a reformulation of this fetish within the economy of female sexuality. If a fetish signifies a lack, it may not necessarily be, as in the Freudian orthodoxy, the lack of a penis but, more essentially, the lack of a presence. Desired women in Akerman\'s films are often constructed as missing, inaccessible, lost. Signifying the ever-changing, ever-torturing distance between subject and object, the clicking of the heels is an important trope in the construction of her cinematic space. In her universe the shoe might be a fetish, but it is a fetish in motion, always connected to a gesture, an inflexion of the female body: polishing it, putting it on, taking it off, standing, pacing, walking, running, dancing.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFew filmic oeuvres pay more attention to the musical, emotional and structuring roles footsteps can play in narrative. There are countless instances in which the arrival of the beloved woman is preceded by the sound of her footsteps, in which the tap-tap-tap of high heels function as a permanent echo of a female protagonist\'s mundane activities or hidden emotions. Footsteps also signify the complexity of human interactions in a city, or sometimes, simply, the presence of other human beings. Reaching the bottom of her depression, the heroine (played by Akerman herself) of “Je tu il elle” (1974) stops \'paying attention to the footsteps. They were too numerous, or too loud during the day.\' Later, standing naked in front of her window, she hears \'footsteps, which then stopped. Someone was looking at me. So I remained motionless and naked, so that others passing by might look at me.\'\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe male shoe fetishist conceives the connection between the feet and the shoes as unproblematic for the woman; she can slip in and out of them in a second and walk in them without being hindered. However, as women know, high heels can be a torture; they are pleasant to look at but not necessarily to walk in. In “Je tu il elle” Akerman wears heavy knitted socks and uninspired clogs. Michèle, her teenage stand-in in “Portrait d\'une jeune fille”, is shown dressed as a tomboy (blue pants, stripped T-shirt, flat black shoes). She explains to Paul that one of the elements of her conflict with her father is that \'I don\'t want to wear chic clothes. It\'s a torture. Especially wearing stockings.\' Stockings, of course, are part of the fetishistic apparatus that involves garter belt and high heels and constrains feet as well as body. Yet, as she continues talking about her \'weird ideas\' about clothing, Michèle inserts the disturbing comment that \'the name embroidered on the school\'s blouse, it\'s like a stigmata\'. No less disturbing is Paul\'s reply: \'A name, it\'s better than a number.\' Unconsciously, the young people know why Michèle\'s father wants her to dress with a certain decorum, and why she rebels against the emotional weight he\'s laying on her. The dress code is to conjure the poorly forgotten memories of the nudity in the camps, the numbers tattooed on the arm, the exhausting marches on bare, bleeding feet, the heaps of women\'s shoes in the storerooms.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAkerman\'s oeuvre displays an ambivalence between the tropes of forgetting and remembering, as well as about the codes of gender definition. It is my hypothesis that both ambivalences are connected, unfolding, one in a tragic mode, the other in a playful one. As in a Jewish joke, narrative pleasure springs from the intersection of these two registers. Most Holocaust survivors said nothing about their experience to their children in order to \'spare\' them. The task of the next generation was to decipher this silence. Akerman never made a film about the Holocaust - even “Histoires d\'Amérique” (1988)(8) unfolds a playful jocularity - but keeps alluding to it obliquely, thus mimicking the indirect discourse of the Holocaust survivors. Similarly, while her narrative strategies shatter the conventional representation of femininity, she still partakes in and is fascinated by tropes that could be qualified as \'pre-feminist\' - bringing this duplicity of approach to its higher level of complexity and artistic maturity in “La Captive”. Already in “Portrait d\'une jeune fille” this ambivalence was beautifully captured. As she is walking on the street with Paul, whom she has just kissed on a whim, Michèle stops in front of a window that we guess to contain a pair of shoes:\r\n<br><br>\r\n- Look at those! Don\'t you find them awesome! <br>\r\n- Yes, you\'re right. You want them? <br>\r\n- You don\'t have to buy me a pair of shoes because of a kiss.\r\n<br><br>\r\nPaul and Michèle are framed in medium close-up, talking to each other while looking in the direction of the window. There is no reverse-angle shot of the famous shoes but, Michèle being a teenager in 1968, we can imagine them as a pair of sophisticated, ultra-feminine high heels. Their conversation drifts toward the nature of Michèle\'s conflicted desires, her \'impossible\' search for \'closeness\', her double attraction for both Paul and \'the one\' she wanted to make suffer. Here we find two of Akerman\'s major tropes. One, at the narrative level, is the woman who loves two people. The other is the refusal to cut and show the object of the protagonist\'s desire. Later, during a party, the camera stays on Michèle\'s face for a long time as she intensely watches Danielle who dances with a young man to the tune of James Brown\'s \'It\'s a Man\'s World\'. At the end of the film, pushed by Michèle in Paul\'s direction, Danielle produces a radiant smile, but the young man is never shown. This cinematic grammar sweetly implies that the pair of shoes is no less an object of desire for Michèle than Danielle is, or later, than Paul is becoming for Danielle.(9)\r\n<br><br>\r\n2\r\n<br><br>\r\nPeople who were once deprived of everything, or whose parents were, are sometimes overcome by a violent, irrational desire for shoes or clothes. The ownership of material goods fills the gap once created by poverty or physical abjection and, on the scale of human emotions, becomes a stand-in for emotional fulfilment. This adds a new perspective to the speech about the \'fickleness of the heart\' that closes “Window Shopping” (1985).(10) In the film\'s last scene, Mr. Schwartz (Charles Denner), the clothes shop owner, attempts to comfort Mado (pop singer Lio) who, still in her wedding dress, has to cope with the fact that Robert won\'t marry her.\r\n<br><br>\r\n- You see [one dress] in the window you\'ve got to have, but maybe it\'s too <br>\r\nexpensive... Or maybe it looks well on the rack, but not on you. So you <br>\r\nhave to choose another. After all, you can\'t walk around naked!\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe same thing goes for shoes (and Akerman makes sure that the Schwartzes sell shoes as well, and orchestrates two close-ups of Delphine Seyrig putting a magnificent pair of high heels on a customer, then on a dummy). Like in “La Captive” and “Portrait d\'une jeune fille”, in “Window Shopping” shoes become the substitute for the women who wear them - half-way between the fetish (they trigger desire) and the sign (they signify a presence/absence). A musical comedy, the film starts on a static medium shot of the smooth, glittering floor of a shopping mall, on which seventy-five-odd women, framed from the knee down, pass, either alone or together, walking or running, in all possible directions. Flowing, colourful dresses or straight black skirts, flat shoes, small heels, formal footwear, sophisticated high heels, blue, red, black, yellow and even pink. The shot lasts 2.10 minutes; over a rendition of two songs of the film (\'The Tango of the Shampoo Girls\' and \'At Night\'), the passing of shoes becoming swifter and swifter, the pace accelerating, and we start to notice that the same shoes, the same dresses, are reappearing. In the mall women are not going from A to B but round and round, like laboratory animals. In the course of the diegesis we may recognise some of these shoes - they belong not only to shoppers but to working-class women: the bevy of hairdressers and shampoo girls who work for Lili (Fanny Cottençon), the salon owner, femme fatale and kept mistress of a businessman/gangster. The shoes these young women wear are not only made for walking but for working; they are their uniforms. On the other hand, the first time Lili appears, royally, at 11:30 am, she is seen descending the stairs in a striking red dress, barefoot, a red bag and a pair of red shoes playfully dangling from her left hand. “Window Shopping” interlaces several narrative strands - the most moving being an unexpected reunion between Jeanne Schwartz (Delphine Seyrig) and Eli (John Berry), the American who had taken care of her when she was just out of the camps. The film\'s red thread, however, is the love quadrangle between the Schwartz\'s son, Robert (Nicolas Tronc), Lili, the young hairdresser Mado and Monsieur Jean (Jean-François Balmer), Lili\'s protector. (Characteristically, Akerman adds more angles to the love geometry, for Pascale, Lili\'s best friend, also pines for Robert and at some point Lili makes a spectacular exit on Eli\'s arm.) In a moment of anger at Lili, Robert proposes to Mado. Yet, on the eve of the wedding, Lili makes a no less theatrical comeback. As she hides behind the stage-like red curtain of the dressing room, Robert recognises her by the way she impatiently clicks her fine black high heels. A few moments later, returning to the shop in her wedding gown, Mado sees Robert\'s and Lili\'s shoes involved in some erotic dance in the space between the curtain and the floor and understands that she\'s done for.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAn even more scattered narration, “Toute une nuit” (1982)(11) follows snippets of the lives of seventy-five anonymous characters during a hot summer night in Brussels. Lovers on the lam, married couples taking a stroll, teenagers eloping, chance erotic meetings, stolen embraces, one-night stands, lovers parting or being reunited, lonely walks through the city, insomniac\'s sleepless moments, a cigarette quietly smoked at a street corner. Some appear only once. We are allowed to follow others, ever so slightly, as their stories develop more fully. A few of these stories stand out, including one that involves the only recognisable star of the lot, Aurore Clément,(12) a woman unhappily caught between the love she feels for one man and the love another man feels for her; she paces her apartment up and down without daring to make a phone call, or runs through the streets to stand below the window of the object of her passion. In another, a housewife packs a suitcase while her husband is asleep, walks away, checks in at a small hotel, and throws herself on the bed, still wearing her white suit and high heels. We see her later, carrying her suitcase on a deserted square at dawn, and then sneaking back home and finally into bed by her snoring husband just in time for the alarm clock to ring and for her to get up. Earlier in the film two strangers, a man and a woman, sit at contiguous tables in a café without looking at each other while the erotic tension mounts. When they get up at the same moment, they violently grab each other.(13) A few shots later they are dancing with a passionate and awkward abandon to the tune from a jukebox. As they slowly retreat in the back of the café the women\'s shoes become visible - a pair of golden high heels, quite improbable for such an occasion.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRealism is not what governs the subtle choreography of “Toute une nuit”. The film is constructed like a musical, structured by its soundtrack as much as by Akerman\'s lauded visual compositions. The mood is given by a few musical numbers whose source is sometimes diegetic (the jukebox), sometimes not. Gino Lorenzi\'s “L\'Amore Perdonera”, a syrupy Italian love song, is overlaid over two crucial sequences - the faux closure of the Aurore Clément story (she dances with one man while whispering in his ear how much she loves the other one) and the little girl dancing (see below). The soundtrack is a multi-layered symphony populated by the tunes and noises of the city and the ever-present sound of footsteps.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAll the women in the film, young and old, pretty or plain, wear high heels and can\'t move without being \'betrayed\' by their constant clicking. Akerman plays on this in two different sequences. A woman goes down a flight of stairs, having removed her shoes to escape unnoticed, and joins a man waiting for her outside. Another, in the morning of a one-night stand with a younger man, attempts to sneak out from his house on tiptoes but is caught by her lover and an awkward but sweet exchange of first names follows. Akerman also pays attention to children\'s footwear. In a disturbing sequence, a tomboyish little girl enters a café where a lonely middle-aged man is drinking himself to an alcoholic torpor. The only markers of the child\'s femininity are her little red boots, quickly glanced at (no boy would wear these), and her voice when she invites the man to dance. Accepting, the man is embarrassed, not knowing what to do with his body, his hands reduced to caressing the little girl\'s short black hair as she snuggles up to him. Then, as abruptly as she had entered the place, she leaves.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe high heels worn by the shampoo girls, window shoppers and anonymous passers-by in “Toute une nuit” and “Window Shopping” are as artificial and \'theatrical\' as tap-dancing shoes in American musicals and fulfil a similar function: they provide a rhythm, a musical counterpoint to the story. Yet, never losing her sense of irony, Akerman acknowledges they can be a bore to wear as well. One of the \'Jewish jokes\' of Histoires d\'Amérique is passed between two men, but it could uncannily fit (or \'misfit\' as the case may be) women.\r\n<br><br>\r\n- Oi! My shoes hurt! <br>\r\n- Why are you wearing them? <br>\r\n- I owe money to the butcher, to the baker, to the landlord. I have two <br>\r\ndaughters so ugly, who knows if I\'ll be able to marry them. My son is a real <br>\r\nidiot. And my wife nags, nags, nags. Each time I come back from a fruitless day <br>\r\nof work and look at my bills, look at my family, at that point, I could kill <br>\r\nmyself. So I take off my shoes, and this minute ... it\'s the only thing that <br>\r\nmakes life worth living.\r\n<br><br>\r\n3\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe most famous woman in Akerman\'s cinema, Jeanne Dielman, does not experience the relief of taking her shoes off - except at the very end of the film. A full-time housewife and part-time hooker, she does a lot of walking, even though her wanderings are mostly confined to a restricted space - from her bedroom to the kitchen to the living room, to the grocer\'s, cobbler\'s, post-office, the vendor of notions, the little square, the café where she sits in the afternoon, the entrance where she greets her johns, the bedroom again, the bathroom where she scrubs her body afterwards.(14) It seems important to rescue “Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles” (1975) from being described as a \'realist\' film simply because it explores the semiotics of women\'s daily gestures as nobody had done it before. Instead it alludes to, subverts and reworks the tropes of genre film. As in a horror movie, the spectator is put in a situation of suspense, experiencing a vague feeling of gloom, waiting for the catastrophe to happen, for the \'monster\' to spring out of nowhere and kill. And like a classical musical, it features a glamorous blonde whose clothes, shoes and haunting tap-tap-tap are given centre stage.\r\n<br><br>\r\nJeanne abides to a strict, abstract dress code. She wears a generic white blouse covered by a blue cardigan, with a black skirt and conservative brown heels. Her colour-coding is unwavering. When working in the kitchen, she puts on a blue housecoat, which she takes off as soon as the doorbell signals the arrival of a john. When she goes out, she has a light-blue coat on. In bed she wears a white nightgown, and when she goes to the kitchen to polish her son\'s shoes and prepare the coffee in the morning she puts on a blue bathrobe, slightly shorter than the nightgown, with a pair of short-heel light-brown slippers. Between breakfast and the moment she says goodbye to her son, she has managed to slip back into her full \'dowdy-but-formal\' attire. Never seen barefoot (as Akerman elides the bedroom scenes, but one), Jeanne is constantly accompanied by the clicking of her shoes or slippers that resonate in the empty apartment for her ears only, or signify, at different moments, femininity-for-sale or loving-but-distant motherhood.\r\n<br><br>\r\nJeanne is shown as lacking a language of her own (she\'s unable to talk about herself, as her son, Sylvain, keeps entreating her to do with an earnest and boyish insistence that will monstrously develop into Simon\'s feverish questioning of Ariane). It is as if the musical tap-tap-tap of her heels was her only form of aural expression.(15) She clings to it, as a signifier of both her identity and her lost dignity. From the little she reveals, one surmises that this loss occurred before her husband died, before she started turning tricks in the afternoon. What happened to Jeanne and her family during the war? What or who killed her parents, forcing her to live a dull life in her aunts\' house? Why is it that nothing seems to matter, as if everything had been rendered insignificant by an overwhelming catastrophe? One Jeanne echoes another, and one is reminded of Mrs. Schwartz (also played by Seyrig), whose heart was \'dead\' after what she\'d seen in the camps leading her to choose a dull life with a man she didn\'t really love rather than passion with the American soldier.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAs Jeanne Schwartz says, \'as long as there is food to eat\', or as her husband adds, as long as people buy clothes, things will be okay. For the alternative is too horrible: \'If we don\'t make it through, there\'ll be another horror. And this time none will be spared.\' It is another Jewish joke that \'while Jewish men have the Wailing Wall, Jewish women have their families\'.(16) Families to cry over, indeed, but also to feed, clothes, hold together and manage. While Jeanne\'s ancestors may have walked miles in the Polish or German plains to find food for their children, she matter-of-factly turns tricks to feed her son. This is what a good Jewish mother should be able to do.\r\n<br><br>\r\nJeanne Dielman is an Ashkenazi Jew; her family and Akerman\'s come from the same parts of Europe - they share the same history, but not the same daily habits. \'When I started working on “D\'Est”\', Akerman recounts, \'I was surprised to see that at home, people were wearing bathrobes and slippers. In my family, in Brussels, we used to change into such clothes as soon as we got home, but nobody else I knew did the same. I found the origin of that custom in Eastern Europe.\'(17) While Jeanne peels potatoes in real time, the way she dresses is not entirely \'realistic\'. And maybe, in our excitement at seeing women\'s work represented so accurately for the first time, we forgot the specific work of the filmic text itself, we jumped to conclusions about the referent (a mistake common to \'misrepresented\' people) instead of focusing on Akerman\'s masterful command of cinematic signs. The real-time filming of some actions - such as similar moments in Jean Eustache\'s “The Mother and the Whore” (1973) - was not meant to have a documentary value but to convey a certain quality of emotion, a certain essential truth about Jeanne\'s inner life and maybe ours. Cinema works through visual and aural means to communicate the invisible and the inaudible. A blue cardigan and a pair of shoes sometimes say more about human life than the Kierkegaard aphorisms that young Michèle earnestly quotes to Paul.\r\n<br><br>\r\nJeanne\'s formal-wear, especially her shoes and slippers, are the corset that holds her soul together, the dam that prevents abjection and disorder from pouring into her life. For we know all too well who the women are who went barefoot in history - those who lost everything in a pogrom, those who left their suitcases at the entrance of the camp, those who went naked to the gas chambers. And as the other Jeanne (Schwartz) fiercely hopes, \'that won\'t ever happen again. Never again.\'\r\n<br><br>\r\nYet catastrophes, even minor ones, do happen. A john stays too long, the potatoes burn, my son speaks with a Flemish accent and is slipping away from me, an unexpected orgasm shatters my body, and here I am, trying to repair my composure with this idiot in my bed. In the last ten minutes of the film, Jeanne never puts her shoes back. When she goes around the bed to stab the man, we only hear the sound she makes when she picks up the scissors. Gone is the tap-tap-tap of her heels, the solemn, sad, yet stylish music that had marked the rhythm of the entire film. In the last shot Jeanne sits silently in the living room, waiting. Comparable to moments in “Je tu il elle” or “Toute une nuit” (always at the apex of a crisis), the drone of the traffic and city noises invades the room. The dam has collapsed; real life is entering, yet too late, Jeanne\'s world again.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFor you can never keep reality completely at bay. The film that most echoes “Jeanne Dielman” is a minimalist documentary (long, uninterrupted sequence shots, no voice-over, no translation), “D\'Est” (1993),(18) shot in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. It is also a film resonant with footsteps. They make a joyous sound when people are crowding the streets wearing stylish footwear to keep on with their busy day, when they go on a family outing, seek the excitement of the night, or go dancing. It becomes more grim when shoes are crushing frozen snow, clicking against icy roads, stepping over freshly fallen snow, wading through slush, or when ageless peasant women, wearing unsightly rubber boots, are picking potatoes in a muddy field. It becomes a sinister sound when emanating from crowds of people waiting in the street, under the snow, at night, in the dead of winter - or in immense waiting rooms - or in noisy train stations. Akerman captures the agony of waiting through relentless tracking shots (some lasting over six or seven minutes). She skips the referent so we don\'t know what these people hope to find at the end of their wait. Food? Ration coupons? Administrative papers? Jobs? The arrival of a train, of a bus? These moments become instances of pure waiting, multiplied into hundreds of conscious minds. Some read books or newspapers, some knit, some carry children, some sleep, some talk or complain, some stare vacantly ahead of them or look at the camera with absent-minded curiosity. Gone are the smart city shoes and dancing shoes. People are wearing no-nonsense clogs, heavy boots, bootees; they stamp their feet to keep warm or express their impatience; they are going nowhere, they have walked far in the cold to arrive here, and now they are stuck. Nothing is more desolate than the noise of immobile footsteps, giving the space of waiting its typical, unmistakably recognisable resonance.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThere are many ways of waiting - being motionless, pacing up and down, or running because you can\'t stand it anymore. You can wait for love, for the potatoes to cook, or you can wait for the train. And if love comes, or if the train arrives, you don\'t know where it\'s going to take you: maybe to another horror. The originality of Akerman\'s representation of women is that she shows them as active desiring subjects, even when they seem to be repressed or in a position of passivity. Instead of focusing on Jeanne\'s alienation, why not praise the incredible courage and gumption this middle-aged widow is displaying when turning tricks (as difficult a job as any) instead of despairing or turning to welfare? Instead of seeing Ariane as \'acted upon\' by Simon\'s desire, why not see her as a modern woman who, by loving men and women at the same time (not an easy feat), acts upon her own desires? Whether they are waiting, hiding, cooking or running, Akerman always shows women on their feet. Their shoes, indeed, were made for walking.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSpecial thanks to Yvonne Rainer who showed me the importance of women\'s high-heel shoes in “Toute une Nuit”, and indirectly inspired this text.\r\n<br><br>\r\n— Bérenice Reynaud\r\n<br><br>\r\nFOOTNOTES<br>\r\n1.

What other filmmaker, for example, would have offered all her resources to her bankrupted producer, as Chantal did for Paolo Branco in 2008? Instinctively – never a matter of doctrine but of living proof – Chantal Akerman lives and acts day-to-day the teaching of Emmanuel Levinas: thinking through the Other. We shall see how this ethics structures a conception of the image. On the one hand, we find iconophobia, that is, the rejection of the idolised image (‘in the Sanhedrin Tractate, it is written: one must not say to another, wait for me by such-and-such idol’ – Maimonides, “Laws Concerning Idolatry”). On the other, figurability: an analytical relationship to the world founded on a deep understanding of the complex interplay of projections comprising human exchange – an interplay that the cinema can legitimately take as its very material.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn the heat of the summer of 2011, although busy with the release of her new film, Chantal Akerman offered all the time needed to elaborate on this interview – which she reread and corrected while scattering I don’t know throughout, to reject, with characteristic tenacity and exactitude, any pretense of mastery. I have organised this wealth of material like a small, private encyclopedia, both alphabetically and chronologically, while interweaving commentaries on the films chosen by Chantal for the carte blanche series offered by the Viennale (The Vienna International Film Festival) and screened at the Filmmuseum. The title of the interview is, of course, a homage to the 1957 musical comedy “The Pajama Game” (the “Golden Eighties” of its era), which, Jean-Luc Godard wrote so well, yields to an ‘unrestrained’ joy in freedom, ‘the pleasure and the need to dance’.

Let’s give this interview a concrete, historical frame: it’s July 2011, you’ve just finished “Almayer’s Folly”, and we’re talking against a backdrop of violent economic crises and revolutions. How are you taking them?\r\n<br><br>\r\nCHANTAL AKERMAN: I was born in 1950, in a very poor family, but in the context of the post-war era, things were getting better and better, at least in the Western world. Today, it’s hard to imagine what will happen once we’ve suppressed everything that allows people to get by halfway-decently. Or unfortunately, maybe it’s not so hard to imagine.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: Do you think that the next revolution could come from the extreme right in Europe, that the Arab Spring could be suppressed by the fundamentalists?\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: Maybe. Maybe, yes, there are days when I tell myself that. I always believe the worst. Unfortunately, history has tended to give me reason. In 1941, the Americans knew that the war was won, and they started to organise the escape of the Nazi heads with the Vatican. In 1972, they appointed a criminal, an old officer in the stormtroopers, to the head of the UN [Kurt Waldheim, Secretary-General from 1972 to 1981]. Power has no soul. You can’t be surprised by anything. Today, the neoliberal lobbies insist that we cut the budgets for education, health, assistance programs for the poorest people – everything that makes the world livable. Two years ago, during the first crisis: I was in Miami, and in the Haitian quarter I saw all the multi-coloured houses closed up and barricaded. I wanted to paint some sheets different colors and write a soundtrack taken from what happened to the people who lived in these houses, and make an installation.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: Why didn’t you do it?\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: When things don’t happen right away, I lose my drive.

So begins your note on the film’s intentions before shooting.\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: Yes, the first note. There have been so many more.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: For me, ultimately, I saw a film centred around primal feelings, a film about l’amour fou, a portrait of a man in terrible love with his daughter. Is it anything like an idealised portrait of your father?\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: No, no, certainly not. I don’t think we need to go rifling through my autobiography. It’s imprisoning.\r\n <br><br>\r\nIt’s the problem of love in general: is it for the other person or one’s self? Almayer is driven by the love he thinks he holds for his daughter; overwhelmed by his calamitous life, he has nothing else. He represents the anxious, depressed side that his daughter won’t share.\r\n <br><br>\r\nAlmayer and his daughter represent two characters and sides of me: the daughter who dares to leave home, as I did when I was a teenager; and the depressed father, who, like me, is immersed in his own sense of loss. We fall back on autobiography. Better not to. Anyhow, that’s how I explain the film to myself, for the moment, and my desire to make it – but everything is always more complicated. Or much simpler.\r\n <br><br>\r\nWhen I read Conrad’s book, there was one scene that struck me: the father is going to talk to his daughter, so that she’ll stay with him, so she’ll return. It moved me to the point of tears. I don’t know why or how, but I genuinely believed this feeling. It’s not the colonial who interested me. That same night, I saw Murnau’s “Tabu” (1931). And I felt a sort of spark between this scene and “Tabu”. And it was at that spark that the desire to make this movie came about.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: What exactly does Almayer want for his daughter?\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: For his daughter, I don’t know; he needs a reason to live. To exist. What could he give his daughter? Nothing.\r\n <br><br>\r\nWhen she leaves with a guy she doesn’t love, it’s because anything would be better than staying with her father. It’s her mother who pushes her, her mother’s who’s more practical. Maybe it’s better to get to know someone to be able to love them later on, like it used to be in arranged marriages. Little by little, they can learn to respect each other. Well, sometimes. In the end, I don’t know.\r\n <br><br>\r\nART MARKET<br>\r\nNB: You entered into the field of cinema on your own, without going through a school or institution or group, and little by little you’ve carved your own path through force of will, without ever compromising. How did you get into the sphere of plastic arts?\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: By chance. I’ve never seen myself as an artist. Kathy Halbreich, who was working in a museum, asked me to do something. I set myself to it. It started like that. I enjoyed it, I kept doing it.\r\n <br><br>\r\nTo make ‘art’ is usually wonderful. The art market is another thing. It’s often tied to power, to the phallus – but not always.\r\n <br><br>\r\nIn cinema, when you make a film, even for four people, anybody at all can enter the darkened theater; it’s democratic. In the art world, there’s an elitism that reigns sometimes that’s tied to capital. Fortunately, not always. In the Renaissance, the Medicis let Michaelangelo make revolutionary work like ‘The Slaves’. Claude Berri, who, like my father, was a small Jew who came from leather and fur, would get up and say he was looking at his Yves Kleins. They were his. What was he really looking at, the painting or its value? Both, without a doubt; I don’t know. Ultimately, it’s touching.\r\n <br><br>\r\nMy father also started to buy paintings at the end of his life. Bad paintings, but he liked them. I find it very moving.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: Today the speculators don’t buy the works they like; they put their names on a list and wait to acquire a painting they haven’t seen by an eminent artist.\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: Fortunately, they’re not all like that. But it’s true, for example, that the paintings sold at auction fetch astronomical prices.\r\n <br><br>\r\nAfter the revolution – and it really was one – of Duchamp, a kind of perverse spirit has quietly taken hold and now everything is supposed to be art. When Steve McQueen spits on the ground, he declaims that it’s art. I know, it’s a provocation – but not only that.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: So how do you manage to work in the context of the modern art market?\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: It’s turned out that, up to now, I’ve been able to work through intermediaries whom I’ve respected. Not only in public museums, also in private markets. I respect Suzanne Pagé, at one point the director of the Museum of Modern Art, who advises [Bernard] Arnault. There have sometimes been real modern patrons, like Sylvina Boissonnas, the Schlumberger heiress, who sponsored the Zanzibar group and then, unfortunately, the ‘Psychoanalysis and Politics’ Group. Or the De Menils, also from the Schlumberger family who, instead of locking their works up, founded DIA Beacon and transformed an old Nabisco factory not far from New York into an exhibition space.\r\n <br><br>\r\nBut in the end, art usually serves the rich – the phallus. Occasionally, there are collectors who are really in love with art. Again, nothing’s simple. Before the war, the gallery owners kept the artists alive – not through speculation, but through love for the artists and their works. Even when it’s exhibited, often in palaces, art becomes just the exhibition of a limitless ego. But, all the same, it’s good that it gets shown.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: Jonas Mekas had a line about Mankiewicz’s “Cleopatra” (1963): why all this lavish delirium on-screen instead of just buying a big gold nugget and exhibiting it directly as is?\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: Ah, I hadn’t heard that one. The Golden Calf. Idolatry. And before the Golden Calf, slavery, the pyramids. We have to reread Exodus, it remains so true.\r\n <br><br>\r\nI’m not on-board with Polanski’s “The Pianist” (2002): art doesn’t serve a powerful purpose, it doesn’t reconcile people with each other. And not European art. I sometimes have the impression that German Romanticism led to the war. But maybe it’s just an impression.\r\n <br><br>\r\nBOOK<br>\r\nNB: Besides your scripts for “Les rendez-vous d’Anna” (Albatros, 1978) or “Un divan à New York” (L’Arche, 1996), you published two books: one play, “Hall de nuit” (“Night Lobby” L’arche, 1992), and a story, “Une famille à Bruxelles” (“A Family in Brussels”, L’Arche, 1998).\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: For many reasons, I believe more in books than images. The image is an idol in an idolatrous world. In a book, there’s no idolatry, even if you can idolise the characters. I believe in the book; when you immerse yourself in a huge book, it’s like an event, an extraordinary one.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: What books were events for you?\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: It happened more when I was young. These past few years, one event has been Vasily Grossman’s “Life and Fate”, published fifteen years after he died. And Varlam Shalamov’s “The Kolyma Tales.”\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: Two Russian stories that document the war and the camps.\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: Yes. Always that.\r\n <br><br>\r\nThere were heroes in the camps. My mother, when she was 15 in the camp, worked nights manufacturing battle supplies for Krupp. A soldier from the Wehrmacht visited the camps and said, ‘it’s not normal for children to be working at night’, and he moved her to the day shift – but everything else, the imprisonment, the exploitation, the death, all this he found normal! My mother and her aunts were taken care of by an older woman who would save them a bit of bread so they could stay alive. During the death march, when the Nazis saw that they were flanked by the Americans and Russians, they emptied the camps and made the prisoners walk barefoot, or with paper to wrap their feet, from one camp to another. My mother doesn’t realise it, but her aunts supported her when she fainted, and they chewed her food for her so she could eat.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: ‘The world is no more, I’ll have to carry you’, wrote Paul Celan.\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: They were saved by some French soldiers who were heading in the other direction, when they suddenly heard these women talking in French; they stopped, wrapped them in their overcoats and led them to the Bremen bridge on the American side. They brought them to a hospital and fed them bite by bite, which saved them. So many people died by starting to eat again too fast.\r\n <br><br>\r\nBRESSON (ROBERT), “MOUCHETTE” (1967)<br>\r\nCA: The ending of the film, with Mouchette rolling toward the river, is tremendous. With so little, Bresson makes us feel so much about the world: Mouchette rolls alongside all those who have ever been sacrificed; all those who haven’t been just raped but destroyed. All those who have been rolled in the mud.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: Mouchette prefers to remain in solidarity with her poacher-rapist and to die rather than stay with the old village dignitaries. She’s in solidarity with her class.\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: Yes. I don’t know. Perhaps. I only remember the ending. When I was shooting D’Est in the Ukraine, we ran out of gas. Some peasants siphoned the gas from their car to give it to us, but then didn’t want us to leave and prepared a feast. Poor as they were, they cobbled together what they could to offer us a meal of a king. They didn’t know Prokofiev or Shostakovich, but they knew that when someone’s hungry, they have to eat. Stalin himself ‘forgot’ to plan for the plowings, and caused a famine in the Ukraine that led to the deaths of seven million people. Even though he came from there, the Ukraine. Nothing is simple. Those same peasants could still have massacred the Jews in the war. The same peasants or others.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: What’s so frightening in “Mouchette” is that ferocious desire to die, this assertion of death. Mouchette tries three times before she manages to drown.\r\n<br><br>\r\nCA: Yes, it’s often like that when one wants to die: keep trying and then it comes. It’s also a film about France, which could be so beautiful and hides a kind of horror. Later, Mouchette is going to be buried, and the land is tied to the killing. It’s why I don’t trust the land. Blanchot wrote a beautiful text on the Jews and nomadism in “The Infinite Conversation”: he affirms nomadism and the book. (2) No land, no killings: Blanchot explains that land equals blood and that the world is nothing more than an enormous cemetery, still bloody, while the book can be a bloodless land. To live without one’s own land is to risk becoming an enormous slaughterhouse. Nomadism is beautiful and it’s heroic. But is it good to be heroic all the time?\r\n<br><br>\r\nDESIRE<br>\r\nCA: I was living in a maid’s chambers without heat. The winter after ‘68, it was frozen. I was living at 86 or 88, rue Bonaparte, and there was no water. Across from me there lived an old couple, a painter and his wife, in two maid’s chambers where they’d lived their whole lives. I had just a small lamp with me that I put on my belly to keep warm. I went to the student’s residence with my foam mattress that was three centimetres thick. I lived there and met plenty of people, strangers, and they welcomed me. Sometimes I’d put my gear in the hallway. Where I stayed, the ice was thick over the windows; I never lived in luxury, but in Brussels at least our place was warm. My father must have assumed all of his, but he let me go; he obviously knew I’d get by. Paris was the city of dreams, the city of writers, and I wanted to write in Paris in a maid’s chambers. Not in Brussels. My cousin was in Paris, and she paid me a little to take care of her baby daughter. I didn’t take the Métro; I walked. But I still don’t know Paris. It’s all been erased.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: You treat this situation of poverty and freedom in a lot of your films. “Almayer” gives one example, when Nina runs away from boarding school and wanders through the streets, penniless.\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: Yes, certainly. You work with your material. That’s all you have.\r\n <br><br>\r\nLater, I lived on the rue Croulebarbe, in the same building as François and Noëlle Châtelet. With Alex, a young man who was studying Chinese and Laozi, I’d go to Vincennes to listen to Deleuze and Lacan. Lacan was really sarcastic, especially with the girls; he’d take up their questions to mock and ridicule them. He was already into his Borromean knots, and nobody understood any of it. Deleuze, I only saw him one time, I don’t remember it well but I remember the atmosphere: lively, impassioned, fun. I met Alex when I was 13, through DROR, the Zionist-Socialist Jewish movement. Alex had a small allowance to live on, and he came to live with me. He had a tiny hotplate, and I’d buy whatever was cheapest, carrots and rice – it got monotonous. There were showers and some underfloor heating that nobody liked. Alex wanted to take me hitchhiking in Japan, but I left him. He was handsome, despite his acne. He committed suicide, and I learned about it while I was waiting in line to see a film. He also wanted to be Rimbaud. He talked very little about himself.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: In your maid’s chambers, what did you write?\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: I wrote “je tu il elle”, but as a novel, not a film. It was only years later [1974] that I made the film. I hitchhiked back to Brussels to see the girl, Claire, who’s in the film, and I had all sorts of adventures with the truck drivers who picked me up. It was dangerous. But that’s how we lived at the time. I also helped my cousin Jonathan to write a play about Van Gogh, and I read Vincent’s letters to his brother Theo. And then I cracked. I cut my hair close-cropped, I went back; my father was shocked, it was obviously an act of self-mutilation.\r\n <br><br>\r\nDIRECTING THE ACTOR<br>\r\nNB: Do you recount these episodes of your life to your actors, so they understand the stakes of what they’re playing?\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: No. I don’t tell them any of that. And when I make a film, I don’t think about any of it. And the film isn’t even tied to it. Here I’m talking, I’m letting myself go. I’m talking because I think it’s what you want to hear. But a film is something else. I don’t say anything much to the actors. I just try to make the right choice. That’s all.\r\n <br><br>\r\nFor “Almayer”, we didn’t rehearse, I didn’t give instructions; I gave them a space and they went for it. When they moved, we’d follow them, like in a documentary. They were each free to do as they pleased, or almost.\r\n <br><br>\r\nRémon Fremont is a great documentary cameraman; it was with him that I shot “Sud”, “D’est”, “De l’autre côté”, and a narrative, “Portrait of a Young Girl in Brussels at the End of the ‘60s”. At the end of shooting, he cried in my arms; he told me he’d never been so happy. Everybody was really happy; everyone felt like they had their own room to breathe and, at the same time, they felt in harmony together. Stanislas Merhar especially, he understood the path we’d taken, but I hardly told him anything: just some suggestions, sometimes in the most discreet ways. While playing, Stanislas would talk about himself, I think, about his own relationship to life – or non-life: I could tell what he was doing and I accepted it. When we first met, for “La Captive”, he didn’t say a word to the crew during shooting, except to me and Sylvie [Testud]. Everyone thought he was haughty but, no, he was just a little ‘autistic’. He came on-stage and could only see his work. We have a very strong relationship, which nothing could ever undo; we each have total trust in each other. The kind of mutual respect we’ve attained makes everything peaceful between us; it will never be betrayed. As is often the case in cinema.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: Even for the last shot, which is so virtuosic and intricate, you didn’t plan anything?\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: Absolutely not. There was no need. We kept Stanislas’ chair moving toward the sun, very slowly. He talked, he kept quiet, he listened to the sound of the river, he looked at me, I told him to keep going; the scene lasted 10 minutes and I selected a fragment from it.\r\n <br><br>\r\nENERGY<br>\r\nNB: You’ve shown unparalleled energy. You salvaged Almayer from a black hole of extraordinary production problems, like a lot of your work.\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: My energy comes in fits. I spend half my time in bed. Luckily there’s a window now in front of me, and I look outside. Before, there was a wall. I had my first manic episode at 34. My life changed, something broke down: something of that energy that filled me when I was younger.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: What was the nature of this change?\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: Previously, I had felt a kind of energy in life, with moments of depression of course – but I read constantly, took notes, was curious about everything. Then it was gone … The breakdown knocked me out. Before, I walked barefoot in the street, I brought poor people home, I wanted to save the world. Imagine, I telephoned Amnesty International to try to get them to dig a hole to the other side of the earth, to Siberia, so they’d get out all the people imprisoned in the camps! I wanted them to have 10,000 Socialist Jews brought to Israel to change the government and make peace … But I wasn’t living there, and it’s for the Israelis to know what’s to be done. Not for us who live here, for the time being, securely.\r\n <br><br>\r\nI want the days to end early. I go to bed at 5pm, at 8pm, with sleeping pills. Without complaining. That’s how it is. I cope with my illness. It’s an illness like any other.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: So what fuels you? How would you describe yourself?\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: How would I describe myself? My first response would be, ‘I’m a Jewish girl’. But if you asked me, ‘what does it mean to be Jewish?’ I wouldn’t be able to tell you. I had to leave the Jewish community to get by, and sometimes I miss it. When I see orthodox Jews walking in my neighborhood – leaving the synagogue, with their black hats – I tell them, ‘Shabbat, Shalom’, and it does me some good. It’s stupid, I know, but that’s how it is. They look at me weirdly but they respond, in a low voice, ‘Shabbat, Shalom’. At that moment, I feel like I belong – or the opposite, that I’m looking to belong, even for just a second. It’s a funny thing – besides which, I love Israel, even if it’s its own form of exile. One more type. I feel good there, usually, even if I don’t agree with the government. Even if I know that, for Israel to exist, it has to act like other races. To shed blood, and seize lands.\r\n <br><br>\r\nWhen you’re with Jews, even if you hate them, there’s something already present, something unspoken there. (Except with self-hating Jews). There can’t be any anti-Semitism.\r\n <br><br>\r\nStill, it was a Jew who denounced my mother. He was a doorman at a nightclub. He’d hidden my family to get money from them and, when the money ran out, he denounced them. He was taken down by the Resistance; he was an Untermensch. Nothing is simple, and whenever I say anything, I want to say the opposite as well.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: You don’t hesitate reusing a Nazi term?\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: No. Not for this man. Maybe I should leave their vocabulary to themselves, but it has left its marks.\r\n <br><br>\r\nMy father never wore the yellow star. His sisters hid him in a convent, and the nuns tried to convert him. The Jews don’t have the right to proselytise, unlike the Catholics and Muslims. My grandparents were so naïve; they couldn’t imagine what was going to happen to them, and thought they were being taken off to work. My grandmother’s paintings were stolen.\r\n <br><br>\r\nFILMOGRAPHY (ANNOTATED BY THE FILMMAKER)<br>\r\n“Saute ma ville (Blow Up My Town)” 1968<br>\r\nThe opposite of Jeanne Dielman. Charlie Chaplin, woman.\r\n <br><br>\r\n“L’enfant aimée ou je joue à être une femme mariée (The Beloved Child or, I Play at Being a Married Woman)” 1971<br>\r\nA failure, lost.\r\n <br><br>\r\n“Hotel Monterey” 1972<br>\r\nI can breathe, I’m really a filmmaker.\r\n <br><br>\r\n“La Chambre (The Room)” 1972<br>\r\nI can breathe but stay in bed.

It was on young junkies in rehab centers outside New York. It was really beautiful. I lent it to INSAS [School of Cinema of Brussels] and it was never found again, though not for want of trying.\r\n <br><br>\r\n“je tu il elle (I You He She)” 1974<br>\r\nFoolhardy.\r\n <br><br>\r\n“Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles” 1975<br>\r\nHere things get complicated. I’d done what I wanted to do, so what to do next?\r\n <br><br>\r\n“News from Home” 1976<br>\r\nI love it.

Philippe is only two years older than you, and you have a lot of the same reference points, Rimbaud, Godard, and the same minimalist, anarchist tendencies …\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: I don’t know if we have the same references. Young men dream of Rimbaud, not young girls. Anarchist? I don’t see myself in that word. I was there, of course, and I wanted to make films, in ‘68. Yes, Godard, of course, minimalist. I remember when Philippe came to the house to film “Elle a passé” … . I hadn’t slept the night before. He had an old camera, nearly broken. He had to secure the lens with his hand.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: That’s why that film is so stunning.\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: Maybe.\r\n <br><br>\r\nGIRL<br>\r\nNB: You always talk about yourself in terms of a fille, girl, daughter; one of your self-portraits is titled “Portrait of a Young Girl in Brussels at the End of the ‘60s”, and the main female character in “Almayer’s Folly” is named Nina, petite fille or little girl. Fille signifies youth but most of all a filiation, a heritage. For you does fille mean not to be a femme, a woman?\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: Possibly. Probably. I don’t know. I never grew up. I was always an overgrown child. Almayer is a father who has a dream for his daughter and maybe for himself in regards to her. I never followed my father’s dream, to have a family. I stayed a girl, the daughter of my mother. In the end, I don’t know.\r\n <br><br>\r\nMy sister, yes: she started a family in Mexico. She has two beautiful, intelligent children. My niece is getting married soon and the line will continue. Sometimes I regret not having kids. Maybe I would have gone from a daughter to a woman – but whether that was possible for me, I don’t know. Probably not.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: So you determined to remain the girl.\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: I wouldn’t say determined. But it’s what happened. I was the first child. My mother always scolded me for not eating, she obsessed over food. At three months old, I was sent to board in Switzerland, to eat porridge, always the same porridge, and they knocked my chin against the sink if I didn’t eat it. Things got better when my sister was born. As a teenager, I ate voraciously – which bothered my father, since you had to keep skinny to get married. He was a Jewish father, nine years older than my mother, with three sisters he also took care of, and my grandfather who lived with us. To show us what we should or shouldn’t do, he banged the palm of his hand on the table top.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: Something you often do yourself.\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: Yes, probably. In the ‘50s, parents claimed their own authority; they didn’t want to be friends with their kids.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: They were the trustees and guarantors of a law. What values did your parents want to impart?\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: Yes, the Fathers, in any case. You had to be a good human being. To act properly: there was what one did and what one didn’t do, and in the end it was that simple, even when you didn’t agree.\r\n <br><br>\r\nBut, on the other hand, they didn’t encourage me to work at all. My father didn’t pay any attention to school, and for months I didn’t go. My mother signed my report card half-asleep on her bed. They never pushed me to study, even though I was quite good at school. But afterwards, high school was a disaster. Because I was a good student, they sent me to a very wealthy, rigorous high school for the intellectual elite, Belgian Freemason types. I met daughters of doctors, academics and captains of industry. I was an outcast.\r\n <br><br>\r\nMy father became a worker when he was 12. On my father’s side, I come from a family that’s tumbled down the social ladder. My family in Poland was rich, and my grandmother was accustomed to a grand lifestyle. Her three daughters learned to play piano. But then they fled Poland with nothing and my father became a worker, a glove-maker, to feed his family.\r\n <br><br>\r\nHe would have liked a son in my place, so his name would have been carried on. One day I asked him: ‘Have you seen what I’ve done with your name?’ He’d read a few articles on me, but it wasn’t enough; in any case I wouldn’t perpetuate his name, so disappointment was predetermined.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: What was your mother’s name?\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: Leibel.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: Almost an anagram of ‘Liebe’, German for ‘love’. [In Yiddish, Leibel signifies ‘little lion’].\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: In her family, the most important person was her mother. Her father was a cantor in the synagogue and their marriage, of course, was arranged. My grandmother was already a feminist; she wanted to become a painter and get married on her own. She was born in 1905, and her mother was very religious. She didn’t get the life she wanted – no more than my mother, who admitted as much the day after my father died. With a kind of fury. This time, I was the one who couldn’t understand. Am I the repository of all that? Doubtless – all that, and other stuff, too.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: If you go back to your life, your freedom, your creativity – don’t you have the feeling of a kind of reparation?\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: No, definitely not. What reparation? At first, I thought I was speaking out, since my mother never had been able to – but now I know that’s not it. That I never had a choice. Not really. Well, I don’t know.\r\n <br><br>\r\nI lack that kind of drive to be constantly turning my thoughts into actions … But everything comes from the journal of my grandmother. When I got sick for the first time, my mother fled, but left me the diary of her mother, who came from a very orthodox family. In 1919, at 15, she was writing: ‘It’s only in you, dear diary, that I can confide my feelings and my grief, since I’m a woman!’ She would paint in secret on Saturdays. My mother thinks I’m her heir, that it all comes from her. My grandmother made dresses and drew the models herself. My mother’s dream, before the war, was to learn to draw so she could open a fashion house with her mother. But that dream died in the camps along with so many others, and nothing more was possible.\r\n<br><br>                                 \r\nWhen I wanted to make movies, my father didn’t want it. He was scared I’d be overwhelmed, that it would go badly. But my mother said, ‘let her’.\r\n <br><br>\r\nThe diary was the only thing that was left of her mother. I’ve read it a dozen times. My mother wrote a couple lines in it, I did too, then my little sister as well. A whole female tradition. Thanks to it, my mother never believed that men were superior. Of course, she served my father, she gave him the best pieces at dinner … but not in her head. My father admired his mother greatly; he never said so, but I could tell. I only knew her when she was crazy. She held it together during the war, and cracked after.\r\n <br><br>\r\nOne night, I was writing “A Couch in New York” to please my father – thinking that it would bring in money and that money would finally satisfy him. My uncle (by marriage) told me how devoted my father was to his mother (whom I’d only known after she became crazy), more than to their father. That gave me some space to breathe, let me feel somewhat relieved. But it meant I had to save myself. If I didn’t, as a daughter who’s always withdrawn, what would I become? In a clinic my whole life, like one of my aunts.\r\n <br><br>\r\nGODARD (JEAN-LUC), “PIERROT LE FOU” (1965)<br>\r\nNB: You’ve often talked about how “Pierrot le Fou” began your love for cinema.\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: Yes, it was like nothing I’d seen before. I didn’t know that films could be like that. It gave me the force, the desire, this crazy desire to become a director. But watching it again, I don’t like it as much. Well, it depends. I love the part in the South and that song, ‘Ma ligne de chance’.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: And the explosion?\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: Oh, of course, the explosion most of all. ‘Shit, shit, shit’.\r\n <br><br>\r\nHITCHCOCK (ALFRED), “VERTIGO” (1958)<br>\r\nCA: “Vertigo” is visually sublime, a film about fetishism – that is, on not seeing the other person, making them an extension of yourself, reducing and denying them to feed your own anxieties. There are so many other things to say about this movie.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: As Lacan put it, a man can never see a woman.\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: It’s a nice phrase. But then, what are men and women? For the woman, it has to happen as a fantasy, it’s not sex that makes her orgasm; she can be more polymorphous, like a baby. Patriarchal teaching makes her think it has to take place in the orifices, when it really happens somewhere else, without her needing to fetishise her own sex like men do.\r\n <br><br>\r\nICONOPHOBIA<br>\r\nNB: You’re coming back from Cambodia, a country that’s gone through a sort of collective survival. For you, how was this trip through what they used to call the Third World?\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: I had a great experience. If you don’t know the history there, you can’t imagine. You can sense that a generation is missing, but you won’t see any evidence in the individuals or, rather, they don’t let you notice. Everyone keeps smiling, happy, nice. You end up wondering how genocide was possible. The Jews feel the trauma. What really surprised me was the reaction of the little girl who plays the young Nina. She was six years old, she didn’t want me to leave; when I proposed her coming to New York with me, she asked the translator if I had a good heart. It’s the aftermath of genocide: the most important thing becomes kindness. Natalia [Shakhovskaïa], a cello teacher, would say it, too; she’d lived in a world of constant denunciations where they had to keep the water running so the sounds of their talking wouldn’t be heard. In that kind of world, it’s essential you know who’s got a good heart.\r\n <br><br>\r\nBut Cambodia isn’t the only Third World. I never went to Africa, as a filmmaker I couldn’t have; you had to go as a doctor. In Judaism, in principle, images can’t be exhibited; it’s a religion that bans images. It’s got to be part of me: I could never show people dying. I’ve seen it in some films, in those of a young Austrian filmmaker, a dead baby in front of his camera, or even in Depardon’s “Faits divers” (1983) where he films a dead body right after its suicide, while someone asks him to stop. For me it’s murderous, a crime.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: Abbas Kiarostami also filmed a child dying in “ABC Africa” (2001). But in the face of catastrophe, what to do?\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: I can point the way, show the places the bodies are buried. It’s better to evoke, it gets to you and the viewers more effectively. In the end, those literal-minded images aren’t effective, you have to find another path, so that people confronting it can remain themselves and absorb it, actually face-to-face with the images. It’s why I tend to film things frontally.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: But a face from the front, against a wall, is a Byzantine, formal schema and there’s nothing more idolatrous. It’s because of the close-up, as Jean Epstein put it, that cinema generates gods.\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: But it’s material and it moves, even when it seems fixed. And when you avoid low angles and subjective shots, you avoid fetishism. When you film frontally, you put two souls face to face equally, you carve out a real place for the viewer. So, it’s not God-like. You contemplate something that’s fixed. Not an eyelid batting, not a beat skipping.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: So your conception of the image is a battle fought on two fronts: on the one front against literal-mindedness; and, on the other, against the production of idolatrous images.\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: Yes, literal-mindedness closes you off so often. Or rather, it depends what you call literal-mindedness. There’s something for the Jews like ethical order, which concerns the relationship to the Other, something Levinas analysed so well. You’re face to face with the Other. It’s from this crucial face-to-face that your sense of responsibility begins. Levinas would say, ‘now that you understand, you can’t murder’. That’s my idea of ethics. It’s why I want equality, always, between the image and the spectator. Or the passage from one unconscious toward the other.\r\n <br><br>\r\nINDIVIDUAL<br>\r\nNB: The cinema creates prototypes for ways of living, ways to reside in the world. In your work, we can see how you constantly interweave two types of individuals: the sovereign individual, responsible for his/her acts, inventing his/her freedom; and the individual who’s a victim to him/herself, prey to moments of total anonymity.\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: Yes, that’s probably true. It takes ten men to carry a corpse or sing the Kaddish. They can’t be done alone. Besides which, you have to be sure of yourself, without glorifying the individual too greatly. That’s why I’ve been in analysis for ten or twelve years, on and off. I take a breath, I step back. Am I conscious of being an individual? I know that I’m just myself, even though I don’t know what it means to be oneself. My analyst is like a friend of mine; I repeat the same things all the time, stories or situations taken from the Bible – in particular the Judgment of Solomon, in which the good mother is revealed. And of the forty years the Jews spent in the desert to lose all trace of slavery: something the blacks and concentration camp victims didn’t have. The idea is sublime: taking time to shed the traces. Traces of slavery. For the camps, it will take three generations, they say. My youngest niece is sick to her stomach, she’s 27, the third generation. As for my mother, she’s waiting to become a great-grandmother; she’s waiting for the fourth generation.\r\n <br><br>\r\nINSTALLATION<br>\r\nNB: Since 1995 and “D’Est: au bord de la fiction (From the East: Bordering on Fiction)”, you’ve done installations regularly across the world, for example “Woman Sitting after Killing” in 2001, “Une voix dans le desert (A Voice in the Desert)” in 2003, “Women from Antwerp” in November in 2008. Often, although not always, the material of these installations re-emerges in your films. How do you navigate between them?\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: An installation piece is cinema without the hassles – that is, without all the humiliating terms of production. It’s free of all the burdens of cinema. I can work alone, at home, without waiting to find the money. It’s artisanal work – practically by hand – which I adore; there’s nothing like it.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: How do you ‘install’ yourself in all this material you gather?\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: The process is much closer to documentary than fiction. For a documentary, I become an empty sponge: if you start off with a preconceived idea, you’ll obtain it – but you won’t see a thing. When I lock myself in with the material for an installation, it’s like shooting a documentary: you don’t know what will happen, you sculpt your material, it arranges itself on its own. And then, in the blink of an eye, it’s suddenly there, it’s self-evident. For fiction, there has to be a structure with a requisite beginning and ending; you can move the elements around, but you can’t change which way they face; you have to follow the thread between them. With installations, I don’t follow that thread, and it’s magical: multiple possibilities can arise while I work out the material, and that material pulls me on. I work on it, it becomes something else, and then I’m there. Creation comes from transformation; the process is liberating and riveting, a pure joy.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: What are the differences in your installations, as you see their evolution from 1995?\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: The main ones are exploring alternate forms to a single-minded fiction, and leaving new spaces open for the viewer. The technical devices have changed, some are more complex. Not all the installations are tied to my films. I conceived the last one, “Maniac Summer” (2009), out of some original images, and some that were nearly random. I wanted the installation to be a series of abandoned films left in-progress, as if marked by persistent traces after a violent dispersion. The ghosts of Hiroshima gave it its underlying structure. Better if I read you the text written for the occasion:\r\n <br><br>\r\nEssentially: from one orphaned film to another, in progress.<br>\r\nWithout subject or object.<br>\r\nWithout start or end.<br>\r\nA film that implodes.<br>\r\nBetween Eden and catastrophe.\r\n <br><br>\r\nIn progress. In shards. Shards of catastrophes.<br>\r\nA film that reproduces itself at least four times, maybe five, as it’s taken toward catastrophe, as the speed of light seems to be surpassed.<br>\r\nLike at Hiroshima. And like at Hiroshima, it leaves its traces, but in progress.\r\n <br><br>\r\nA film that explodes and floats before dying.<br>\r\nNext to it, the phantoms still are swaying. They continue their danse macabre.\r\n <br><br>\r\nA film that replicates itself until it has lost its colours, like shadows, phantoms, traces.<br>\r\nA film that comes together in a landscape,<br>\r\nAnd drifts apart.<br>\r\nFrom black and white to white and black.<br>\r\nAlmost unidentifiable.<br>\r\nOften almost abstract forms.<br>\r\nThat’s how it will become an orphaned film.<br>\r\nWithout author, without subject, nor object. Silent.\r\n <br><br>\r\nJEANNE DIELMAN<br>\r\nNB: Your work includes a number of self-portraits, and one majestic figure who totally innovated the relationship between portraiture and narrative: the figure of a mother, Jeanne Dielman.\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: While I was writing it, I didn’t understand “Jeanne Dielman”. I didn’t understand it until many years later: it was also a film on lost Jewish rituals, not just about an obsessive woman. If she’s so obsessive, it’s to avoid leaving an hour open to anxiety. And when that extra hour arrives, all her anxiety surfaces.\r\n <br><br>\r\nI understood it after the mental crisis and analysis. I wanted my mother to keep the Sabbath, to light the candles; it came from the death of my father’s father (my mother’s father died in the camps), the man who had accepted me as a girl. At his death, I was still little; they took me out of Jewish school overnight, and it was a shock, since it broke off another connection to my grandfather. To keep the Sabbath, for me, meant reviving my ties with this man who had accepted me as a girl. It’s a really beautiful ritual, powerful and even philosophical when you grasp it. The idea of the ritual has to do with the passage from animal to human. According to the dietary rules, you have to know what’s a milk-product, or product of other foods, you have to think before eating. I like that idea.  I don’t keep kosher, but at least I know the basics. I know why you can’t eat shellfish: because they never fully developed.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: You make me think of Ken Jacobs, who’s explained once that “Tom, Tom, the Piper’s Son” (1969) is a film about a Jewish ritual of sexual initiation.\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: A lot of sexual rites are made so that men might think a little before fucking women. In Judaism, the man is required to please his wife. If not, it’s grounds for divorce. One of my cousins got divorced for just that reason. Friday night, the man has to please his wife, so that he has to get to know her, for five minutes he has to forget about himself. You don’t have to be a believer to subscribe to that. Unfortunately, the ultra-orthodox have changed all this, and often for the worse.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: What was your experience like at the film’s release?\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: At Cannes, after the screening, the first one up was Marguerite Duras. Right away she tried to dismiss the film. She said that she wouldn’t have filmed the murder, she would have made a ‘chronicle’. I don’t think she understood anything. She said, ‘that woman’s crazy’, so she could relate the character to her own world. I was furious. For me that woman was like all the women I’d known as a child. Were they crazy or was it a way to fight against craziness, anxiety?\r\n <br><br>\r\nMarguerite built up airs around herself that she would promote and flaunt non-stop. With Agnès [Varda], we were sometimes competitive, but Agnès is capable of moments of great generosity toward women, where Marguerite was only capable of generosity to men; she loved them madly. It would have been better if I hadn’t met her. We spent three months together, since “Jeanne Dielman” and “India Song” came out at the same time and were shown side-by-side at all the festivals. Marguerite was often on the bad side, first during the war, then with the Communist Party … but there are these flashes in her work; I went to see “Eden Cinema” (1977) on stage, and it was magnificent. And, deep down, I nevertheless liked her.\r\n <br><br>\r\nReally, it’s always better not to meet ‘the creators’. Whenever anyone tells me, I love your work, I’d like to meet you, I always say: it’s better not to. I’ll disappoint you.\r\n <br><br>\r\nLEVINAS (EMMANUEL)<br>\r\nNB: You followed Levinas’ seminars much more closely than Deleuze’s or Lacan’s.\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: Yes, every Saturday I went to ENIO [École Normale Israélite Orientale] at Michel-Ange Auteuil [subway stop]. Lévinas would interpret the verse of the week. Throughout the whole year he’d interpret the Bible, make a student translate a verse and, then, sitting so small on his chair, surrounded by books, he’d start the exegesis: Rashi, Maimonides, etc … The way we learned was by questioning, negation, but mostly questioning. To go to a yeshiva [Jewish religion school] means learning the art of questioning and negation, and this after millennia, after the Hebrew Bible. The Talmud means learning to discuss, to call things into question, to develop your thoughts.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: To acquire a dialectical sense.\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: I don’t think dialectics is the appropriate word. No. And, anyway, it’s a word that’s too associated with Marxism, even if Marx was Jewish and, one way or another, he would have been rooted in this sort of practice of reflection and still more reflection.\r\n<br><br>\r\nNB: Did you keep any traces from Levinas’ seminars?\r\n<br><br>                                                  \r\nCA: No, I didn’t take notes and I forgot everything after my first breakdown. Since then, my memory’s been worse. It was a real disaster, just before “Golden Eighties”, which hadn’t been made as I wanted.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: I remember just how out of place and explosive it seemed in the landscape of the time; nobody was expecting such a joyous, colourful musical. That kind of exhilaration ran completely against the dominant taste in auteur films of the ‘80s.\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: They kept wanting me to remake “Jeanne Dielman”, but I wanted to spurn everything – spurn my father’s name, not repeat myself. I did a number of trial runs for it, and “Les Années 80 (The ‘80s)” and the others are possibly more joyous than the final film, which suffered from a lack of resources, among other reasons. In any case, I was very happy to write the songs. [She sings]\r\n <br><br>\r\nMÉNILMONTANT<br>\r\nNB: Why did you decide to live in this underprivileged district of Paris?\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: I don’t consider it underprivileged – on the contrary. I love living in this hybrid neighborhood; I’ve lived here for 20 years, and before that at 107 rue de Ménilmontant. Like every town, there’s a local crazy guy, Gaspard, and the village takes care of him. The building across the way includes 89 different nationalities. I’ve seen children grow up, the building decay; nobody does anything. A young man was thrown through a window, they amputated his leg. Now he spends his life on a bench with a giant radio listening to rap. When I go past him, he always says ‘How’s it going, Chantal?’ Oh, it’s going well. Sometimes he says ‘Madame Chantal’.\r\n <br><br>\r\nMURNAU (F.W.), TABU (1931)<br>\r\nCA: Such simplicity, such economy, such beauty in how it treats its young characters. Such horror toward the persecutors. I love “Sunrise” (1927) too, but in “Tabu” things go worse, the couple doesn’t recover like in “Sunrise”. There’s no good and bad woman.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: In “Almayer’s Folly”, the shot of the boat with all the young people asleep seems like a cross between “Tabu” and “The Night of the Hunter” (1955).\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: It’s possible. I don’t have any visual memory, only emotional; I don’t remember exact shots, only what they evoked for me.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNO<br>\r\nNB: Often, when someone asks you a question, your first impulse is to answer ‘No’. Like a lot of writers and artists, you’ve been given a powerful instinct for contradiction; you make me think of Faust’s line in Goethe: ‘the instinct that always says no’.\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: But no! [Laughing] I answer no when the answers imprison me in a grid, a system of interpretation. And I don’t want to take it, to accept being simplified. But after saying no, I open up. When I know a topic really intimately, I want to take my time to explain it well and open up. I don’t want to hold just one thought; I want to have different thoughts that can play on different perspectives. So I say no when I find myself in the grips of some ‘agenda’ for example. One of the people I’ve really loved to have a dialogue with on art is Lynne Cooke, an Australian curator. She asks questions wonderfully, always in this open way. The first time we met, it was the day after the wrap party for “D’Est”; I’d drunk too much the whole night, I’d barely slept. Suddenly the bell rings, I open the door, and she’s there. I don’t remember anymore if I was even supposed to see her. I didn’t even know who she was. She’s pure in a way without being a purist. And she’s made me think a lot, one of the best thinkers when it comes to art these days, I think.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: What contemporary artists interest you?\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: Richard Serra, always – for me he’s the greatest sculptor, the greatest visual artist. To enter into his sculptures is to forget time and space, to be immersed in a physical geometry, which I love. In music, Kurtag, Scelsi and Monteverdi.  In ‘68, Stockhausen’s “Momente” came as a real shock, my first shock of contemporary music. Everything he’s done chorally is very beautiful.\r\n <br><br>\r\nIn 1971-3, when I was in New York, I was plunged into the discovery and emergence of all these aesthetic ideas. I especially loved Charlemagne Palestine, Phil Glass ... but now Phil Glass, it’s turned into such a simple system, it doesn’t interest me anymore. The others are still looking.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNOVEL [ROMAN] AND FAMILY ROMANCE [ROMAN FAMILIAL]\r\nNB: In “Almayer”, Marc Barbé and Stanislas Merhar represent the two faces of the same father figure, the one an evil wheeler-dealer, the other a passive lover who lets himself get carried off in the dreams of adventure of the first; and both of them taking care of the girl, Nina, in the same ways. Otherwise, we don’t know why it’s Lingard (Marc Barbé) who pays for Nina’s board, rather than Almayer.\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: I hadn’t thought of that. That comes from the book. But Barbé offers more of a paternal image than Stanislas. He’s the bad father – that’s why I put him in a tuxedo, we imagine he spends all his nights at the cabaret. He’s not an adolescent like Stanislas; he’s a man, with all the bullshit men will float, and the idiotic dreams of money with which he infects Almayer.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: In Conrad’s book, the character of the young man, Daïn, plays a much more central role. In the film, we see very little of him.\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: I shot more scenes with him, but they overloaded the film. In fact Daïn belongs to the dreams of the Chinese man, because he dreams of the best for Nina. I wanted a nice, sweet scene when Daïn meets Nina.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: In the book, Daïn leads an anti-colonialist revolt. In the film, you’re explicit that he could have been an insurgent who was trafficking in drugs or arms. The battles for liberation that form the backdrop of Conrad’s book aren’t even hinted at in the film. It wasn’t a loss, diminishing the character so much?\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: It would have had to go into a history of the country. That would be another film.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: Where does the first scene of the film come from? It’s not in the book. Did you improvise it on location?\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: No, it was written. For Nina’s song, I hesitated before taking Mozart’s ‘Ave Verum’ in Latin, a Christian song in a greasy nightclub – but it’s more amusing and totally out of place. It’s one of the few songs I learned in school.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: Why did you decide to play the voice of the Mother Superior, i.e., within the film, the source of harassment and the law?\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: I didn’t decide to. At the moment of filming, someone said to me, ‘do it’. When I say, ‘he’s one of us’, it’s a phrase from my father.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: I thought it was a phrase from Tod Browning’s “Freaks” (1932), that awful refrain: ‘one of us’.\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: No, it’s a question that my father always asked, ‘is he one of us?’\r\n <br><br>\r\nPAJAMA<br>\r\nNB: While you’re shooting, how do you set up a communal lifestyle?\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: Each film is different, and finds its own life, its own grounds. The rules develop on their own, and are not spoken, even if that means they’re not rules. I don’t need to establish hierarchies. For “Jeanne Dielman”, I got into an argument with a sound mixer. She thought we were going to make the film collectively – it was the great era of Maoism. She would judge Delphine, since Delphine came from the haute-bourgeoisie. But it was Delphine who was taking the most risks for the film, not her. Rules prevent us from living. I go out in my pajamas, I’ve dispensed with fashion. I filmed all of my last film in pajamas. Today, I’m in my pajamas.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: You had a follower in Michael Jackson, who showed up one morning in pajamas for his trial.\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: Michael Jackson was the master of transformations, nothing could stop him from remaking himself.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: In the end, nobody could assign Michael Jackson an identity anymore. He was the human being who transformed into a type of transformer.\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: Yes.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: I remember how the example of Michael Jackson helped certain of my mixed-race students.\r\n <br><br>\r\nPASOLINI (PIER PAOLO), “MAMMA ROMA” (1962)<br>\r\nCA: I love this woman. Her generosity. I feel sad for her when she gives the money to the gigolo. Her son dies like another Christ – that’s a weakness of the film, for me, without a doubt because I have a sort of revulsion towards Catholicism. Unfairly, I’m sure. The film is great, not for its fiction, but its documentary dimension, with Anna Magnani as female character. When she’s walking with the other prostitutes during that uneven tracking shot, clearly taken from a car, and you follow along in her joy and that of the other women – for just this shot, the film is very great.\r\n <br><br>\r\nA PLACE ON EARTH<br>\r\nCA: I look at how determinedly my mother wants to live, even though everything in her is falling apart. She’s got a lively spirit, completely the opposite of me. Because, for 15 years, before being taken to the camps, she could believe in the world. While for me, I was born into trauma. My sister Sylviane and I, we’ve had to take care of her these past three months but, even on a stretcher, when my mother sees a handsome young man, she flirts. Me, I was born with anxieties. My mother never let me negotiate a real separation from her – or maybe I’m the one who couldn’t do it, as I have trouble even existing. When I was little, since I knew how much she’d suffered, I let her have her own space. I would never cry, never say no. Little by little, I’ve realised to what extent, when I was younger, I didn’t have the space to be a woman. My mother still calls me ‘mon amour’ all the time, I can’t stand it. In Judaism, you’re not required to love your parents, only respect them. Sometimes I don’t feel either love or respect and, sometimes, the very next day, there’s too much of it. My mother’s mother died in the camps, so she didn’t have to take care of her when she was old. The last time my mother broke something, she fell down in the night but, thanks to the adrenaline she didn’t feel anything for a little while. The next day, I had to take her to the clinic; I said to her, ‘Mama, you’re not 18 anymore, when you go in somewhere, turn on the lights’; she’s 84, but she was so upset that she refused to eat for five days. There was nothing to do, I told myself: ‘She’s letting herself die, it’s her choice, like the old dogs who’d rather not eat so they can die’. My sister came and, since my mother has a completely different relationship with my sister, she’s started eating again.\r\n <br><br>\r\nNB: You think that your mother denied you any right to existence?\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: Oh, I don’t know, it’s all too complicated. Sometimes, I think so. Sometimes, I hope for her death – in the sense that she would have to die in me. Not the woman, of course. Just the mother. But, in the end, I know it won’t change anything.\r\n <br><br>\r\nPOVERTY<br>\r\nNB: We can infer that your never asking for anything, of being content with so little, even depriving yourself – that this structures both your relationship to the world, and a style that’s characterised primarily by asceticism.\r\n <br><br>\r\nCA: I understood right away that my parents had nothing, that I couldn’t have anything or ask for anything. When I do have something, I have to toss it away, disperse it to the winds. I don’t have any great needs; when I was little, I was always put in the background so my mother could have her own life and room to herself, since she’d suffered so much in the camps. Well, that’s what I tell myself now. In any case, I never showed signs of anger; above all, I couldn’t make her suffer.\r\n <br><br>\r\nI wore my cousin’s clothes, which didn’t bother me. My father put me into Jewish school and, in 1956, there was already a class of parents who had remade their fortunes. Their children got their clothes from Dujardin’s, like today kids buy brand-names. When I was 13 or 14, for the first time, my mother directly gave me the money that my aunts had entrusted to her for my birthday. I went to Dujardin’s to buy a polo shirt, and immediately realised I was being foolish; it was the last time I did anything like that. Everyone was going to the beach at Knokke-le-Zoute, to the same place. The beach was divided up by windbreakers, and everyone would be at the same spot, ‘Viaene’. Everybody would change in the little cabins in the woods; sitting in the beach chairs, all the mothers had on these sublime clothes and sunglasses. But my mother was the most beautiful. All the kids had bicycles. My father rented one for me at five Belgian francs a half-hour. The kids played tennis, but I played ping-pong, because it was free. Their ice cream had three scoops, and mine had one.  But I could see how much my father was working, and I didn’t want to ask him for anything, or to reveal anything on the surface. One of my aunts was even poorer, I kept 25 cent coins',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(238,1,'2017-08-30 11:38:08','2021-05-26 16:59:42',4,'Postscript: Chantal Akerman',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'postscript',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Richard Brody',_binary 'The Belgian-born, Paris-based director Chantal Akerman died on October 5th, at the age of sixty-five. According to Isabelle Regnier, of Le Monde, she committed suicide. Neither Akerman’s name nor her work is as widely known as it should be. It is no overstatement to say that she made one of the most original and audacious films in the history of cinema, “Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du commerce, 1080 Bruxelles.” It premièred at the Cannes Film Festival, in May, 1975, the month before her twenty-fifth birthday.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAkerman was younger than Orson Welles was when he made “Citizen Kane,” younger than Jean-Luc Godard was when he made “Breathless.” The three films deserve to be mentioned together. “Jeanne Dielman” is as influential and as important for generations of young filmmakers as Welles’s and Godard’s first films have been. Akerman presented monumentally composed, meticulously observed, raptly protracted images of a woman’s domestic routine—Jeanne (Delphine Seyrig) preparing cutlets in her kitchen, for instance. These images prove cinematically that the domestic lives of women are the stuff of art; that women’s private lives are as ravaged by the forces of history as are lives lived on the public stage of politics; and that the pressures of women’s unquestioned, unchallenged, and unrelieved confinement in the domestic realm and in family roles is a societal folly that leads to ruin, a form of violence that begets violence.\r\n<br><br>\r\n“Jeanne Dielman” is an intimate film of majestic choreography. It distills a cinephilic passion—for classic Hollywood melodramas, Godard’s long takes, Jacques Tati’s pointillistic comedy, and Jacques Rivette’s and Andy Warhol’s experiments in duration—into an utterly personal and distinctive form. It takes on the subjects and the clichés of melodrama, such as prostitution and murder—those, in particular, of so-called women’s movies—and extrudes them with a profoundly modern psychological resonance, as well as a political fury.\r\n<br><br>\r\n“Jeanne Dielman” is also a Holocaust film, with a protagonist torn by her memories, as were Akerman’s own parents, who were Holocaust survivors. Akerman’s last film, “No Home Movie,” screening at the New York Film Festival tomorrow and Thursday, is a film of her mother, Natalia, in her Brussels apartment, and among the subjects that they discuss are the events leading to her deportation to Auschwitz and the attempt to return to ordinary life in Belgium after the war.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn effect, Akerman transformed the visual styles and narrative forms, the dramatic syntax and artistic codes of the modern cinema, into a woman’s cinema. Subjecting the art to a kind of free aesthetic psychoanalysis, she worked in a vast array of genres and forms. She made her personal life—and her body—the subject of her 1976 film, “Je, Tu, Il, Elle” (I, You, He, She), in which she plays the lead role, as a lesbian who travels to visit her ex-lover (Claire Wauthion). That year, in New York, she filmed one of the most resonantly painterly and personal city pictures, “News from Home,” the soundtrack of which features letters written to her by her mother. Her 1982 film, “Toute Une Nuit” (One Whole Night), is one of the most delicately choreographed of all love films, a fusion of observational documentary and the bittersweet theatrical precision of Max Ophüls’s exquisitely scathing romances. Her choreographic inventiveness fused with Pina Bausch’s in the 1983 documentary “One Day Pina Asked …,” as well as in the 1986 musical “Golden Eighties,” set in a Brussels shopping mall where the antic and seductive comings and goings are marked by the legacy and memory of the Second World War. (There, Seyrig plays yet another Holocaust survivor named Jeanne.)\r\n<br><br>\r\nShe made one of the great cinematic coming-of-age dramas, “Portrait of a Young Girl at the End of the Nineteen-Sixties in Brussels,” one of the great documentary self-portraits, “Là-Bas,” and, in 2011, an ecstatic, hallucinatory yet trenchantly political adaptation of Joseph Conrad’s novel “Almayer’s Folly.” She anticipated that movies would burst the bounds of theatres to take up residence in museums and art galleries, creating installations based on several of her documentaries, and, in 2008, an original gallery installation, “Women from Antwerp in November,” a fusion of cinephilic consciousness and female identity that seemed like the seedwork for a new decade of dramatic features.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAkerman also made a wildly rapturous, sinuously erotic Proust adaptation, “The Captive,” which came out in 2000. With its fusion of Hitchcock and Mozart, of frozen poses and burning desires, it’s nearly as radical a refraction of melodramatic forms and moods as was “Jeanne Dielman.” It’s also how I met Chantal Akerman.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn June, 2000, after the première of “The Captive,” at the Cannes Film Festival, it had its première screening in Paris. I was in Paris to do research for a Profile of Jean-Luc Godard, and I wanted to talk to Akerman about his work, because, famously, she was inspired, at the age of fifteen, to make films when she saw “Pierrot le Fou.” The listing for the screening of “The Captive” mentioned that Akerman would be on hand for a Q. &amp; A., so I went in the hope of meeting her afterward.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAnd that’s what in fact happened—but first I saw the film with astonished delight, and then witnessed the Q. &amp; A, which was unlike any that I’ve ever seen, before or since. The audience was composed mainly of young people, of the age of college students or recent graduates, and, after the screening, they were eager to engage Akerman in discussion about the film. A young woman sitting behind me raised her hand; Akerman called on her, and the viewer asked a fairly complex question filled with academic language. Akerman responded sharply, “Is that how you talk to your friends?” The woman stayed silent; Akerman persisted, asking whether the question represented the way that the young woman talks in real life and wondering why that’s the way she chose to talk to Akerman.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt was a hard lesson for the young woman; it was a lesson for me, too. I would have hated to be on the receiving end of Akerman’s tirade—as, if I had asked a question first, I might well have been. If there’s one thing that Akerman achieved in her films, it’s the elevation of private life, of what’s extraordinary about what’s seemingly ordinary, into the apt matter of art. Her work is recklessly, freely personal, and she came before the audience that day in order to have a personal discussion in public. In a few harsh phrases, Akerman changed forever the way I think of—and approach—events onstage. She made me think about what I say and, with her emphasis on the intimate, the sincere, and the spontaneous, made me not overthink what I say.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWhen I spoke with Akerman in the hallway after the screening, she gave me her phone number and address. When I called her soon thereafter, she invited me to visit and interview her at her apartment, in the Twentieth Arrondissement. There, she offered me chocolates from Belgium. While we talked, her phone rang. It was her mother, and they talked for a little while. She spoke with love about Godard’s films, but she also spoke about the sense that she got from one of his recent films, “JLG/JLG,” a cinematic self-portrait: “You watch it and say to yourself, ‘Oh, my, things aren’t going well for him at the moment.’ He must be really sad to make this film. I’ve rarely seen a film of his that gives me such an impression of sadness.”\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt’s inevitable that, in the wake of Akerman’s death, her last film, “No Home Movie”—a title that twists doubly around itself to suggest a movie about no home, about the feeling of having no home—will give a terrifying impression of sadness. Its empty rooms and still foyers, blank doorways and yearning distances, the looming threat of death will inevitably, for now, seem to dominate the passionate and vital energies, the drive for creation and for life that inspire it as well.\r\n<br><br>\r\nTHE NEW YORKER, Richard Brody, October 16, 2015\r\n',_binary

1985\" is a sculptural installation and performative work comprising thirteen garments recreated from a scene in the 1985 made-for-television video called \"Can’t Beat It Alone\" which included footage from the Greenham Common Women’s Peace Camp, an all-woman, anti-nuke protest encampment (1982-2000. In \"W.I.T.C.H. 1985,\" Lesperance recreates a cloak worn by a protesting individual: black, hooded, and with various popular 80s-era women’s power symbolism. This unusual and theatrical robe also heralded a probable affiliation with W.I.T.C.H.—the Women’s International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell. Founded in 1968 in New York City, W.I.T.C.H. was a socialist feminist group which rallied for a range of leftist policies, and declared that:\r\n\r\n\"If you are a woman and dare to look within yourself, you are a Witch. You make your own rules. You are free and beautiful. You can be invisible or evident in how you choose to make your witch-self known. You can form your own Coven of sister Witches (thirteen is a cozy number for a group) and do your own actions... You are a Witch by saying aloud, \'I am a Witch\' three times, and thinking about that. You are a Witch by being female, untamed, angry, joyous, and immortal.\"\r\n\r\nThe cloaks are reproduced as accurately as possible and include embroidered and beaded components, and multiple silkscreen printed surfaces. The thirteen cloaks of Lesperance’s \"W.I.T.C.H. 1985\" can be re-activated in performative ways that return a sense of agency to the garment in the service of “untamed, angry, joyous, and immortal” actions. \r\n\r\nWhen the garments were deinstalled in November, they were donated by the artist to the contemporary activist group WITCHPDX.   \r\n\r\n\"W.I.T.C.H. 1985\" coincided with THE SUBJECTS, an exhibition and presentation of Lesperance’s novel, \"Peace Camps,\" and Greenham Common Women’s Peace Camp archival material. \"The Subjects\" was a project of Converge 45 in collaboration with the Portland Art Museum. \r\n\r\n\r\nEllen Lesperance\r\nTHE SUBJECTS\r\nPortland Art Museum, Crumpacker Family Library\r\nAugust 9 - November 5, 2017\r\n\r\nEllen Lesperance published her first novel \"Peace Camps\" in 2017, a novel partially set in the Greenham Common Women’s Peace Camp in Berkshire, England. The exhibition, titled \"The Subjects,\" features the book, published by the Portland arts press Container Corps with illustrations by Jeffry Mitchell, as well as archival photographs, source materials, and other texts linked to the all-woman, direct-action, anti-nuclear-proliferation occupation established outside the Greenham Common Royal Air Force base from 1982 until 2000.\r\n\r\nLesperance invokes the work of female activists in her art; the Greenham Common Women’s Peace Camp and the rich archive of images of their campaign have long inspired her.

In \"W.I.T.C.H. 1985,\" Lesperance recreates a cloak worn by a protesting individual: black, hooded, and with various popular 80s-era women’s power symbolism. This unusual and theatrical robe also heralded a probable affiliation with W.I.T.C.H.—the Women’s International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell. Founded in 1968 in New York City, W.I.T.C.H. was a socialist feminist group which rallied for a range of leftist policies, and declared that:\r\n\r\n\"If you are a woman and dare to look within yourself, you are a Witch. You make your own rules. You are free and beautiful. You can be invisible or evident in how you choose to make your witch-self known. You can form your own Coven of sister Witches (thirteen is a cozy number for a group) and do your own actions...

It was well into the summer of 2005, and she was one of only four women in residence. I was there with friends to stage a photograph for an art project, and in return for our use of the land, I was to have my seven-months-pregnant belly painted with henna by Nic, who was interested in building her own portfolio. She had been trying to make a living selling homemade jewelry to tourists at the flea market, a formidable task when faced with crowds looking for cheap turquoise. This is where the henna idea comes in. My friends and I had brought in water and groceries for her but we ended up eating most of them because many were perishable and there was no electricity. Nic picked sage for us outside the back of her living structure and added it to browning butter cooked over a propane heater: sauce for some packaged ravioli. She had a desiccated lemon wedge stored above her sink that she offered us with the tea she served. She told us how much she was looking forward to a drive into the city later that day to take a hot bath at a friend’s place. She showed us how to use the pit bathroom out back, how to cover our waste with a handful of ash.\r\n\r\nI was deeply affected by the strangeness of this setting: Nic the steward of a land lying dormant and scattered with the debris of an earlier era. There were still at least a dozen woman-built structures used for domiciles; they were small and in various stages of disrepair. One was an old delivery truck painted over all in turquoise, slivers of paint from its peeling windows were curling off and littering the ground. There were Styrofoam cooler parts and plastic water jugs littering the landscape, especially – due to the pitched incline of the acreage – collecting at the base of trees. There was the continual sound of tarps flapping in the wind. Nic’s house was one room, maybe ten by twelve feet, jutting out from the side of the hill. Inside, she had space enough for a double bed and a roller-top desk, a loaded bookcase and some elaborate shelving above a sink basin. For hours she sat beside me on her bed as she drew her elaborate design on my stomach, and in this time my mood became more and more downcast as I struggled to imagine what it might be like to live as Nic lived: marooned, susceptible, completely disenfranchised. I strained to understand Nic – who for her part seemed affable, undeterred, talkative. And it was Greenham Common that she wanted to discuss. Nic had come to this place after leaving Greenham Common.\r\n  \r\nDuring the Cold War, the Greenham Common USAF/RAF Airbase was the location of the largest depository of nuclear “Cruise” missiles in Europe. Since the 1600s, these 1,200 acres of land had been reserved for common-use; for many citizens who had no private assets, it provided grounds for hunting, for gardening food reserves, for recreation and picnicking. It had, nevertheless, been utilized off and on by English troops throughout its extensive history. In times of peace, the acreage could be accessed and utilized, in times of war, this access was often revoked by the English military. In 1979, however, a decision was made in a secret NATO Headquarters meeting to convert the Greenham Common into an American airbase. In this closed-door meeting, the common was designated a more permanent role in the ongoing Cold War as it was earmarked for conversion into: one million tons of concrete and asphalt paving, twenty-one petroleum fuel stations, countless underground fueling tributaries, and storage holdings for ninety-six nuclear warheads, each with the capability to destroy a city a dozen times the size of Hiroshima. This was an era of an explicit understanding in Mutual Assured Destruction, M.A.D. If the U.S. struck, the Russians would retaliate, and they were likely to retaliate by bombing Greenham Common.\r\n \r\nIn her 2004 essay, “Jailbirds I Have Loved,” Rebecca Solnit considers the contemporary feasibility of Thoreau-style civil disobedience in the U.S. and, instead of coming down predictably on the issue where one might expect in a post-Patriot Act era, she finds examples of stunningly effective recent protests: the shutting down of the 1999 WTO conference in Seattle, the continuing anti-military work of Code Pink, (and I would add, of course, any number of regional direct action campaigns that find against-the-odds successes). “If people could stand up to Pinochet,” she writes in her essay, “if the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo could march in Buenos Aires during the time of the generals, if people could speak up in Prague in the 1980s, we can here, far more than we do.” \r\n\r\nThe idea of a “Euroshima” or a limited nuclear war that would be played out in a strictly European theater led to the deferment of hundreds of American nuclear missiles to Europe: to Greenham Common, to another English site in Molesworth, as well to sites in Sicily, West Germany, Holland and Belgium. These American military installations made it likely that it would be the English (or the Sicilians, or the West Germans) who would face the wrath of potential American aggression and not the Americans themselves. It is important to connect this Cold War-era occupation with current U.S. occupations and to recognize how our contemporaries in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in a very similar way have suddenly found themselves living in the target zones of an American War on Terror. In England in the early 1980s, 87% polled were sure they would not survive if a nuclear warhead was dropped on England and 49% thought this was indeed likely to happen (1). This population “was marked” by these installations: “If there is a nuclear war, I am sure I will die. I will either die from the initial blast, be vaporized or crushed, or I will die in the ensuing weeks from radiation sickness” (2). \r\n\r\nThere is a constellation of reasons why I believe the Women’s Peace Camp that formed at Greenham Common should be brought into the light for further examination. Not the least of which is its ability to serve us as an inspirational and pertinent model right now. The question of this essay is whether that pertinent model can be both a civic model and an “artistic model.” In an article in the July/August 2010 issue of “Art Papers” entitled “From Artistic Activism to Geocritique,” theorist Brian Holmes laments: “We need a concept and a practice of transnational, cross-class collaboration that go way beyond the old ‘intellectuals and workers’ model, but manifestly, neither is available.” Indeed, this concept and practice is the legacy of many Creative Direct Action campaigns, and yet these activist histories fall outside of standard art discourse. A remarkable component of the camp that developed at Greenham Common was its reliance on visuals, primarily performative and sculptural display, to command the creative opposition that provided, in many cases, the backbone of these women’s efforts at civil disobedience. Creative Direct Action is a category of creative making that provides powerful models for politically-inclined artists, and offers a methodology that makes dissent visible in the public sphere. Contemporary Relational and Social Practice artists are afforded cultural cache for far less effective dissent practice. Is it worth our while to examine the vast creative projects that exist and have existed within activist campaigns? \r\n\r\nThe beginnings of the Greenham Common Peace Camp began as a September 1981 march by a group of primarily Welsh activists calling themselves “Women for Peace on Earth.” They walked for seven days from Cardiff, Wales to the site to deliver a letter to the then-Secretary of the State of Defense, Francis Pym. In the letter, they called the arms race “the greatest threat ever faced by the human race and the living planet” and challenged him to a debate. Pym was dismissive and in fact invited the group to stay as long as they’d like. That is how a peace camp of nearly twenty years found its beginnings: an impassioned desire to communicate dissenting opinion being met with casual disregard. During this era, approximately twenty such camps were erected outside of military bases around the world. The ones in Seneca, NY and Kent, WA in 1983 are examples of more temporary U.S. installations, while the protest by the intrepid Concepcion Picciotto across from the White House in Washington D.C. is an example of one that continues to the present. These camps, and their nonviolent campaigns of direct action against the smooth functioning of the might of the military-industrial complex were effective in many ways, keeping the nuclear debate at the very forefront of local and international media coverage notwithstanding. \r\n\r\nFor many women like Nic, the steadfast protagonist of this essay, there was no other moral choice but to head for one of these camps. Solnit again reminds us of Thoreau’s incantation against loss of faith in her aforementioned essay: “I say, break the law. Let your life be a counter-friction to stop the machine. What I have to do is to see, at any rate, that I do not lend myself to the wrong which I condemn.” And indeed, many first-hand accounts presented in the multiple small-press publications that came out of the Greenham camp attest to this sentiment: that there was no other ethical choice but to go. Women of all ages and walks of life made their way to the Greenham Common camp – including Green Peace activists, Miners’ Wives union groups, and a Manchester-based Prostitutes’ Collective – to unite under a common goal of pacifism. Many were self-identified mothers who were fearful of the world their children would inherit. Some traveled from afar to attend one of the camp-planned events, some were frequent visitors who would remain for short stints or stay weekends away from school, and then there were the women that made the Peace Camp their home for multiple years – Nic was one of these women. \r\n\r\nAnd they were “all” women. After a debated but early decision, men were disallowed. They were barred for essentialist reasons, although it was an essentialism that history itself had done a very good job underscoring: that women did not have the aggressive social tendencies that brought about wars. Many early campers had accumulated experiences from prior activist campaigns, and had felt the strong arm of patriarchy present even under the most benevolent of campaigns. Camper Leslie Boulton in “Greenham Women Everywhere” explains: “They find that it’s a very bureaucratic set-up, invariably run by blokes... We all sit down and we are informed and we find ourselves talking to the backs of each other’s heads... I want to express what I’m feeling, but there’s no space for me to do it.” These women did not want a male spokesperson for their cause, one they saw as, in part, a TAKE THE TOYS FROM THE BOYS-style direct confrontation against the masculinity of the military industrial complex. They wanted to band together to support one another in an expression that they considered to be more caring, more nurturing, of one another and towards the history of the planet.  \r\n\r\nThe women who collected at the base were there to upset the smooth functioning of the military compound in its zeal to convert itself into a nuclear holding facility. Around-the-clock residence at the site enabled the women to closely watch the activities on the base and organize themselves to mobilize the appropriate disruptions. By the end of 1983, nine distinct campgrounds or “gates” were established around the nine-mile periphery of the Greenham air base, distributing the campers to all reaches for observation. These gates were named for the colors of the rainbow and each had distinctive attributes and populations that made them more or less desirable to any new camper. Nic recounted to me the way that women who were new to the premises would undergo a sort of social typecasting to ensure that they “fit in” where they decided to make camp. And it is interesting to note the various sub-categories of leftists that she identified to me as she made clear that the vegan anarchists preferred to consort with their own (at the Turquoise Gate), as did the hippies, as did the intellectuals, as did the population of campers that she labeled specifically as “the flag burners.”\r\n\r\nThe campsites themselves were ramshackle and ever changing. Evictions of campers and the early-morning destruction of campgrounds began early on, as it was decided by the local authorities in the Newbury District Council that no permanent structures were to be allowed. This meant that sleeping, eating and protecting oneself from the elements – all basic human needs – came with extreme difficulty. A type of structure called a “bender” was born of the need for impermanent shelter. Still attentive of the pacifist ethic to do no harm, live sapling trees were not harvested but simply bent over and securely weighted to the ground, providing the framework required for overlays of tarp, canvas and plastic sheeting. These were low to the ground, burrow-like, and typically large enough to house one or two women. Other shelters consisted of tarps hung over clothing lines to create rudimentary tents. These provided some protection from the elements but very huddled sleeping quarters. \r\n\r\nTo get at the quality of life at Greenham, the remarkable contrast between the opposite sides of the fence needs to be imagined. For many, the vast military compound – its austere, stripped landscape, its behemoth architectural structures, the mechanics of its orderly operations, its uniformed population of trained soldiers – is possibly the easier of the two sides to conceptualize. To call to mind the other, one must do one’s best to envision a fully outdoor encampment housing potentially hundreds of women that was in the process of being made up anew every few days. Imagine the litter, the wind-tossed debris, the piles of sacked trash, the accumulating residue of past shelters, the unidentified belongings. Imagine the perennial dampness and the layer of plastic sheeting draped on and underneath absolutely everything. Here and there, folding tables were erected and covered with the food that had been donated or scraped together for the week: loaves of sliced bread knotted shut against bugs and the weather, jars of peanut butter and preserves, powered milk, a water-filled basin for washing. Clothing lines hanging heavy with sopping fabrics were strung from every intermittent tree that wasn’t already being used to create shelter. The campfire was central and typically had a tripod erected above it from which an oversized cooking pot hung. This is where the standard fare was cooked: porridge, curried lentils. This was where a kettle boiled water for tea. \r\n\r\nOne theme that repeatedly surfaces in the literature coming out of this camp was the theme of “not knowing” – not knowing if a Red Alert was an exercise or if in fact a catastrophe was eminent, not knowing if the warheads on the road were in transport or if they had been deployed. This lack of security created an ongoing, palpable anxiety for these women that functioned powerfully as a window out through the layers of apathy that had once immobilized them. No longer were geopolitical issues to be debated abstractly. A lifestyle was maintained that enabled them to feel the veracity of the fact that they were under direct nuclear threat, that they could be killed – at any instant – and that everything that they loved would be killed along with them. They managed to implicate their survival instincts, and at that point it was impossible to remain passive.\r\n\r\nAll direct action was nonviolent, and relied upon the women courageously putting their bodies on the line. This presented a physical reality that the authorities struggled to respond to: hundreds, sometimes thousands, of defenseless female bodies and the attentive media nearby. In 1983, when the first of the cruise missile convoys started appearing at the base (these convoys would continue for seven years until 1990), trucks would enter and leave the airbase virtually every day. Every day provided another opportunity for protest: the laying of one’s body down upon the roads, the disruption of the assembling of pipeline, protest against the transportation of plutonium along the countryside’s roads, the disruption of military exercises, Creative Direct Action campaigns.\r\n\r\nIn the regrettably still relevant 1895 Charlotte Perkins Gilman short story “An Unnatural Mother,” a gathering of fictional townsfolk repeatedly maligns Gilman’s protagonist, Esther Greenwood. Esther, the child of a widower, is represented as out of conformance with the array of social forces that would have shaped her into a proper young lady. Seemingly, this divergence caused her to do the unthinkable in Gilman’s story: warn the villagers of an imminent dam break before rescuing her own infant son from his crib. To the reader, Esther is indeed the most ethical of heroines, singularly responsible for the survival of three villages of people. By the rescued, however, she remains spited for proving no aptitude to her appropriate duties. Likewise, the media attention showered upon the women who took up the cause at the airbase was stereotypical and far less than favorable (“harridans” and “a fairly gruesome bunch” in “The Spectator,” “burly lesbians” in “The Sun”), as was the response from many of the local citizens whom the Greenham campers were indeed looking to forewarn and protect (3). In the nearby town of Newbury, posters advertising vigilante groups forming ‘against’ the women were posted. These groups destroyed and threw feces and blood onto the women’s campsites; they threatened to disable the local standpipes the women relied upon for water. \r\n\r\nThis animosity serves to remind us of the power of direct political intervention. In her 2007 essay “Artistic Activism and Agonistic Spaces,” Belgian political theorist Chantal Mouffe presents her ‘agonistic model’ and persuades us that public space (such as the space that surrounded the Greenham airbase) is an ideological “battleground” that gives rise to a particular type of conflict: conflict that she recognizes as ‘the necessary factor’ for a working, thriving democracy. In her article, Mouffe values the way that many art practices are aimed at challenging dominant hegemonies and accomplishing the kind of agonistic affront she champions. She argues that “[what] is needed is widening the field of artistic intervention, by intervening directly in a multiplicity of social spaces in order to oppose the program of total social mobilization of capitalism.” It is hard to confront this theoretical model and not be moved to better consider the activist-oriented spaces where Creative Direct Action has thrived. These are not art actions in art spaces but better conjure up picket lines, human blockades, banner drops, student occupations, and street theater performances. Work like that of Code Pink, with their stories-tall “pink slip” banner drops. Work like the graphic BP = BAD PEOPLE signage that infiltrated a live congressional press conference and ended up on the front page of “The New York Times” (May 11, 2010), or the concrete use of real, dripping oil on recent spill disaster protest banners. Work like that of the Greenham campers.  \r\n\r\nIt is evident that the women at Greenham were questioning the dominant hegemony, and that their critique was totalizing and covered everything from the vast ethics of nation states to the smaller ethics of partnering with other individuals and with the land. Interestingly, they were not always most maligned for their disruption of the military installation as much as for their transgressive affront to a much broader net of commonplace societal expectations: their lack of “femininity,” their sexual preferences, the fact that they frequently shaved their heads (a practical tactic given the circumstances), their public breastfeeding (although other mothers, like Gilman’s Esther Greenwood, had left their children behind, and either solution to mothering was seen as inappropriate), the slogans they wore on their bodies, the disarray of their campsites. Here was a lack of regard for the sorts of measures that one takes in a public space to display one’s compliance with a shared symbolic order. A transgressive disavowal was at play, niceties melted away, and, in comparison to the obscene display of military wealth represented by the new air base installation, squalor developed on the other side of the dividing fence. When I met Nic on the hillside commune in New Mexico, its destitution struck me as a marker that its idealism had faltered, and indeed this is a commonplace reflection that I hear made by those who visit communes still extant from past decades: that they are disorderly, that they are squalid and impoverished. Yet, in reevaluation, these challenges to delicate status quo sensibilities seem to prove quite the ‘opposite’ of faltering ideological commitments. \r\n\r\nAs I have discussed, the women at Greenham faced incredible hardships. They were frightened, angry, and uncomfortable. Many were arrested and served multiple prison sentences (primarily for, of all things, “causing a breach of peace”). Nevertheless, they stayed. Many were convinced that the more protest activity they generated, the more ‘visible’ their dissent would become; this, they believed, would rattle other women around the world from the sanctuary of their passivity. This need to make ‘visible’ is a sort of a call for visuals. In an interview with Suzi Gablik in “Conversations Before the End of Time” (1997), Performance Studies scholar Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett defines the artist’s role as one of turning “value into form.” Indeed this was the practice at play at these camps: developing a symbolic visual language through which to argue their particular ethic. In many cases the protest actions gained their effectiveness through the creative components, as these components continued their argumentative role when reproduced as images in the press.  \r\n\r\nThere was a type of visual language established at the camp that was specific both in its aesthetics and specific in its use of metaphoric symbolism. Of all other potential symbols to be claimed for meaning, these women selected two that were most frequently utilized in the service of their protest: the ‘snake’ and the ‘web.’ Both provided subtle but perfectly apt metaphoric language for the struggles they were facing. The snake is an animal that outgrows its skin and needs to entirely shed that encasement in order to move forward with its life. The lesson for humankind inherent in the use of this symbol was, for these women, a platform from which an event like their February 7, 1983 action grew. This action was staged on a day that the Secretary of State for Defense was visiting from Newbury. Three snake “costumes” were utilized that had been created from cloth yardage and sheeting. Each snake was long enough for approximately thirty women to crawl within, and together the approximately one hundred women removed some of the bolts from the bottom of the base’s perimeter fence to allow for their low, undetected entrance. One snake was able to “slither” the entire length of the compound before being forced off. Clearly, an action such as this develops meaning around a self-identified symbolic order, as, at the same time, it is a visible dissenting action ‘and’ calls attention to the security of a nuclear holding facility. On June 25th of the same year, an additional version of this event was enacted, only that time with 2000 women and a snake that grew to be over ‘four miles long.’\r\n\r\nThe ‘web’ provided an additional metaphor that was highly utilized in the service of political self-identity. Within a web, each singular strand is a tentative, delicate thing. However, the network of interdependence achieved, the strength of the whole, would never belie this. The spider, as well, is willing to spin and repair this network tirelessly. Weaving woolen webs around the camp was the single-most common creative act at Greenham. Web stringing was also utilized as a tactic for complicating access by the military and police to certain sites of protest. Jane Lockwood, a camper that kept a diary of her time at the camp explains: “we occupied the site where they wanted to begin digging... For an hour about 20 of us wove a huge web of wool and string across the whole area. We entangled ourselves in it, some women sat amongst the threads, others lay beneath it” (4). Additionally, woolen webbing that some campers associated with the practice of darning was commonly woven into the perimeter fencing to call attention to its damaged areas, the breaches in its security. This tactic, however temperate it may seem, is repeatedly represented in reports as having been particularly inflaming to soldiers. \r\n\r\nMultiple web-centered events also transpired within the camps. New Years Day, 1984, is represented by an especially grandiose action in which a spectacularly huge web was first “spun” and then connected to hundreds of helium-filled balloons that lifted the structure to float suspended above the base. It is reported that there had been additional discussion by campers to fill those balloons with bits of tinfoil to prove how easily the base’s radar system could be dismantled; but this lesson was decided to potentially endanger more than it safeguarded. \r\n\r\nA camper quoted in “Greenham Common: Women at the Wire” describes what the creative spirit of the camps looked like in 1983: “Today we got up to a bit of bother to put it lightly. We’ve been painting rocks with beautiful things; we’ve made signs and written words with them but it has to be seen to be believed.” Time in wait of activity on base was typically at hand, so the knitting of water-repellant wearables, the creation of signage, the painting and arranging of rocks, and the decoration of surfaces was quite commonplace. Video footage and photographs from the site document symbolic usage that extended far beyond snake and web imagery. Within the aesthetics of this camp and its actions, a veritable women’s history of symbol usage was at play. There were sweaters with knit-in ideological symbolism: double (labrys) axes, phoenixes, rainbows, anarchy signs, and women’s liberation movement fists. There were the “painted canvas” exteriors of the benders, many featuring goddess portraiture, landscape paintings and celestial maps. There were sheet music transcriptions of Greenham rallying songs and musicians playing in accompaniment: “Here we sit, here we stand, here we claim the Common Land. Their arms shall not command. Bring the message home.” There were women who performed extended “keening” sessions whereby they stood together and loudly wailed and cried out in lament. There were protest signs made on sheets and fabric yardage, and sometimes these were sewn together to create miles-long processions. And so it was “No Euroshima” embroidered in black on a ground of marigold floral that begat NO MISSILES IN EUROPE with the O in NO turned into an universal woman symbol that begat an appliqué black crescent moon on a ground of red starbursts that begat a left to right peace dove ascension that begat a painted depiction of people of all nationalities interlocking hands around the surface of the earth, and so on, and so forth.\r\n\r\nThe base’s peripheral fencing was additionally repurposed to transcend mere barrier designation and instead provide a surface for the display of every last cherish-able object that the campers held in their possessions: children’s clothing and toys, photographs of loved ones, letters from home and from supporters. There were, of course, the lovingly darned areas. There was an endless supply of abandoned scrap plastic that could be cut into various colored strips or rolled, knotted taut, and used as “fabric” to create woven designs in the fencing. There were expanses that were camouflaged natural with foliage and Christmas evergreen. There were elaborate cut paper installations and signage that pled, in hundreds of different ways, for peace. Chris Mulvey, a camper who came to the camps from Dublin, spoke of the perimeter fence not as a barricade but as “a womyn’s collage of life” (5).\r\n\r\nMany of the first-hand accounts by the women who lived on the base described a recognition that befell them: that the act of ‘creatively changing something’ was a sort of an opposite of violence. Many saw creativity itself as a gesture of anti-violence. Creative Direct Action is the already extant term for the visual accompaniments that coexist alongside many activist campaigns. According to the forest defense movement’s The Ruckus Society and their self-published and freely downloadable “Creative Direct Action Visuals” (2007), these projects additionally “unify your group, amplify your message, invite people to have a personal interaction with your work, and provide a visual story through symbols that clarify the issue.” In this handbook, The Ruckus Society asks that the artist/activist creating visuals considers the site of her action when considering its scale and the appropriate medium. They advise that a message is kept “short and sweet” and that it is tested out “on a lot of people before you commit” to “[m]ake sure it makes sense to your target audience and to the general public, and not just insiders.” This insistence on clear, unequivocal messaging is what, I believe, keeps Creative Direct Action on the periphery of art discourse while, at the same time, it provides the strategy that makes the work effective. \r\n\r\nIn “Greenham Common: Women at the Wire,” Babs Schmidt, a camper and drama student from Germany, recounts a Hiroshima Day Creative Direct Action event staged on August 6, 1982 which demonstrates the effectiveness of such clear messaging. First, she and other campers collected 100,000 stones. Each stone represented one of the 100,000 people killed during the first instant the bomb dropped on the city of Hiroshima in 1945. These stones were brought to Newbury’s war memorial, a WWII monument that read “For the Glory of the Dead.” The women bravely stood beside the heap of rocks asking of the townspeople, over and over again: “This is one person’s life, do you want to honor it by placing it with the others?” Because of the clarity of this action, Schmidt reported she was slapped in the face by a war veteran, screamed at by a woman whose husband had died in the war, and spat upon.\r\n\r\nClaire Bishop’s 2006 “Artforum” article “The Social Turn: Collaboration and Its Discontents” cites the “mixed panorama of socially collaborative work” as today’s artistic avant-garde. In these relational practices, collaboration between the artist/author and the audience is initiated (and in so doing making those very terms obsolete) and the atmosphere of democratic community-making is, in many instances, the construction. In many cases, these are controlled micro-utopias wherein it might be imagined that a palliative social encounter can cause some (albeit temporary) alignment to befall the community. Clearly, a social conscience is at play (although at odds with Mouffe’s ‘agonistic model’). In the Pacific Northwest, where I live and where a beacon Art and Social Practice MFA program is housed at Portland State University (PSU), food-based events are very common Social Practice events, as food provides a sort of baseline connectivity, whether it be initializing new micro-economies for food exchange, designing specialty beers for museum-goers, providing exposure to regional foods, or educating around ecological sustainability concerns. In these projects, social practitioners (artists) will often align themselves with grassroots activist traditions and specific political causes, even while imagining that what they are doing is activistic but ‘different’ than activism. \r\n\r\nA program such as PSU’s, which offers a concentration in Social Practice within its MFA, is not alone in offering a student an expensive degree in this growing field (there is another at the California College of the Arts, another at Carnegie Mellon). This access to cultural capital is denied to standard Creative Direct Action activists. The effect of this castigation is twofold. Not only does it sweep aside the creative merit of what they do, but, to my mind, it participates in the suppression of dissent messaging by denying coverage. During the protests at Greenham, it could be certain that depriving the women of media attention deprived them of cultural capitol because what they did – regardless of its scale, regardless of its creative excellence – was rendered invisible. Nic spoke to me about how, years into the activities at the air base, brazen, unchecked civil disobedience was adapted to confront this suppression. To provoke a response, bold actions like the July 25, 1983 base break-in were planned during which seven brave women did an estimated 2.5 million pounds of painted-peace-symbol damage to the U.S. Air Force’s (then) most elite spy plane, the U.S. Blackbird. So wary was the military of revealing its vulnerability, or – through media coverage – of indirectly inviting more women to join the cause, that the women were never reprimanded. \r\n\r\nWhat gives a practice cultural cache? Unfortunately, in her 2004 “October” essay “Antagonism and Relational Aesthetics,” Claire Bishop is willing to dismiss the activistic realm of relational practice as the realm that fails to produce works of merit. In it she writes: “I am not suggesting that relational art works need to develop a greater social conscience – by making pinboard works about international terrorism, for example, or giving free curries to refugees.” For her the criteria for success within relational practices is ultimately an ‘aesthetic’ criteria to be enforced and not, as Creative Direct Action campaigners would have it, linked to a project’s ability to confront a social goal (6). Moreover, the aesthetic criterion that she ultimately lists maintains a surprising attachment to an artistic tradition of obscured intentionality. For example, she asks that relational works “scuttle between sense and nonsense” and “allow multiple interpretations” (7). Santiago Sierra, one of the relational artists that consistently makes Bishop’s cut, can, in a piece such as “Laborers Who Cannot Be Paid, Remunerated to Remain in the Interior of Carton Boxes” (2000), therefore speak broadly about exploitation and capitalism with his audience at a contemporary art venue in Berlin while at the same time preserving a tension between hidden Chechen refugee bodies and a perverted, Donald Judd-like presentation.\r\n\r\nTo my mind, to assign cultural cache to relational works that allow for “multiple interpretations” is to imagine that political directness has little place in Bishop’s contemporary avant-garde. “I can’t change anything,” is Sierra’s working ethos. “There is no possibility that we can change anything with our artistic work. We do our work because we are making art, and because we believe art should be something that follows reality. But I don’t believe in the possibility of change” (8). In his 2008 novel “Diary of a Bad Year,” J.M Coetzee, Nobel Prize-winning South African author, echoes Sierra’s conclusions through the voice of his protagonist, Señor C, a man who compiles short essay responses to various issues of controversy. Under the subject heading “On Guantanamo Bay” Señor C writes: “Someone should put together a ballet under the title “Guantanamo, Guantanamo”! In describing this ballet, the protagonist imagines the type of restrictive costuming that might be designed for the troupe of dancer-prisoners and the regalia and prop weaponry that might accompanying the troupe of dancer-guards as well as the orchestration of movements a choreographer might find appropriate to each constituency. (He also thinks to include in his production a leading role for Donald Rumsfeld.) But as arresting and apt such a work of art might become, as popular and potentially global as its run might prove to be, Coetzee concludes: “It will have absolutely no effect on the people it targets, who could care less what ballet audiences think of them.” Although Coetzee’s critique is written under the protective umbrella of fiction, it nonetheless joins Sierra in offering a stark indictment on the value of what we ‘as artists’ can do politically. \r\n\r\nWhen is art with political messaging pertinent? How can art truly do what Mouffe asks of it: “foment dissensus... make visible what the dominant consensus tends to obscure and obliterate” (9)? Is it possible that Sierra’s “I can’t change anything” motivational credo is a luxury maintained by politically rankling an esoteric arts audience? Surely there are polemical discussions suitable to be art, the Feminist Art Movement provides interesting examples of such projects. In terms of context, here was political struggle that was ‘suitably art’ because much of the redress that was sought was art-based. Many radically confrontational works were designed to express art-based dissent, both in content and in form (think of the Pattern and Decoration movement): to agitate arts institutions, art markets, and the very narratives and mediums that underscored value within its frameworks. Lorraine O’Grady, participant artist in this year’s Whitney Biennial, for example, is possibly best known for developing Mlle Bourgeoise Noire, a character she produced to confront the segregated 1980s art world. Crashing art events and openings wearing a dress made up of tiers of white gloves, she spat out protest messages and recriminations. In many cases, the raw, direct aesthetics and the tactics employed by artists and artist collectives such as The Guerilla Girls, Suzanne Lacy and Leslie Labowitz, Women’s Action Coalition, and Feminist Art Workers, make this work indiscernible from Creative Direct Action. And yet, we as artists make our acquaintance with ‘these’ histories. \r\n\r\nThe Greenham Common was eventually returned to the public in the late winter of 2000. First to go was the perimeter fence, and although it opened the acreage to the populace, no longer was the common what it once was. For example, it took five years for its poured concrete and asphalt paving to be broken apart and hauled away (including all the material from Greenham’s boasted “longest runway in Europe”). Almost two-dozen fuel stations and their adjoining systems of pipelines also needed to be dismantled, and, in doing so, many were discovered to have leaked. Hundreds of thousands of cubic meters of this polluted soil, too expensive to landfill, needed to be aerated (10). The Women’s Peace Camp closed the same year, nineteen years after the September 5, 1981 march by the “Women for Life on Earth” group, and nearly a decade after the end of the Cold War. The last action by the group was the securing of a memorial on the site that commemorated the political activity of the camp and the women who had dedicated themselves to it. Known as New Greenham Park, this memorial includes two commemorative sculptures and a garden planted for Helen Thomas, a young Greenham camper who was killed by a police vehicle in 1989.\r\n  \r\nI think about the sort of bestowal that occurred when Nic shared with me her story and traced symbolic outlines upon my pregnant belly. I wish that, at the time, I had known the history of Greenham Common and had not instead further marginalized such an indomitable woman with the insult of my blank-faced unfamiliarity. My son is five now, he’s into superheroes, and upon watching the terrifying back-story of the infant Superman, he will from time to time ask: “Mom, will our planet ever be on fire?” I don’t know what to say in those instances, when to hope and to wish with profound reserve that the answer is “no” is not to provide an answer. Keeping alive a tradition of ecological consciousness is one thing, but as Barry Sanders points out in his devastating 2009 book “The Green Zone: The Environmental Costs of Militarism”: bike to work as much as you can, reuse and recycle, but it’s military activity that is by far the single largest pollution source in the world – from innumerable exploding chemical bombs to unthinkable amounts of fuel consumption, to the literal littering of nations with depleted uranium detritus. “I know lots of people try to push this into the back of their minds, but I think it is getting harder to keep it there now,” writes a Greenham camper known only as Mrs. Smith in the edited collection of first-hand accounts “Greenham Women Everywhere.” “I’m sure most people are getting the feeling that we are heading towards some dreadful calamity.” There is, of course, urgent work to be done. As politically inclined artists, we need to select the methods by which we might best, in Mouffe’s words, “oppose the program.” \r\n\r\nOn December 11, 1983, pre-cell phone, previous to ready access to the Internet and our present-day assortment of available hand-held computer devices, the women at Greenham Common were able – through initiating grassroots activist tactics: telephone trees, vast letter writing campaigns, leaflet distribution, radio announcements, word-of-mouth persuasion – to gather an estimated ‘35,000 women’ at the air base for its second annual encircle-the-base event. On this occasion, it was decided that the symbolic use of mirrors be employed, and metaphorically for that afternoon, these women contained the evil of the air base within their grasp of hands. They forced it to reflect back upon itself, and forced the watching world to themselves confront such reflection. An action such as this might epitomize the agency of a creative act, and in learning of its example, we allow its message to resonate.\r\n\r\nMarch 2011\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n   1.

But behind their intimations of warmth and coziness are stirring calls to action. The Minneapolis-born artist (who shows at Adams and Ollman  in Portland, where she is now based, and Ambach and Rice in Los Angeles) finds her source material in the archives of Feminist activist groups and at contemporary protests (such as those affiliated with \"Black Lives Matter\" and the \"Occupy\" movement).\r\nIn an interview for Artspace\'s \"Meet the Artist\" series, Lesperance gave Karen Rosenberg some essential background on her life and work.\r\nKAREN ROSENBERG: How did you first get involved with art?\r\nELLEN LESPERANCE: My mom was in charge of crafts at this miserable Christian camp that I had to go as a child, and I think my creative impulses have some relationship to this: to ducking out of Bible school to go hang out in the craft closet. I don’t have memories of a time when I wasn’t involved in making something with my hands.\r\nKR: What other childhood experiences shaped you as an artist?\r\nEL: I come from a really big mixed-race family in the early 1970s in the Midwest—my mom had five kids, adopted three kids, lost two kids. My closest sister is black. People on the street and kids at school called us names, and my family got kicked out of restaurants. I got into verbal and physical fights as early as I can remember. I grew up with raw, tangible feelings regarding inequity and what it means to fight for justice.\r\nKR: What did you learn from art school?\r\nEL: As an undergraduate I was a pretty straightforward figurative painter in a very traditional program. It wasn’t until graduate school that I really got into the visual vocabulary of knitting: its not-square but grid-based formatting, the conventions of its pattern layouts, its language for writing a pattern—American Symbolcraft. I have been working with that vocabulary for twenty years, knowing, loving, that it has implicit limitations and that it\'s inherently Feminist: because women knit, because the history of handiwork is a woman’s history.\r\nKR: What were some important things that you learned outside of art school?\r\nEL: When I graduated from undergraduate art school in Seattle in 1995, I found a union job as a city bus driver for METRO transit. I was really good at my job, but I was also constantly harassed by my coworkers—I was working out of a base that had very few female drivers. I started knitting what I see now as power objects that I would wear under my uniform: things that would change the shape of my body.\r\nKR: Can you describe a pivotal moment in the development of your work?\r\nEL: In 2005, I met a woman in a small Feminist-separatist commune in the hills outside of Santa, Fe, New Mexico. She had been a long-term camper at an all-woman, anti-nuke protest site called Greenham Commons in England in the 1980s, and she told me a few stories. I learned that a remarkable component of the camp was its reliance on Creative Direct Action. The campers\' tents were heavily decorated, the razor wire fencing surrounding the base was adorned, elaborate performances were staged, songs were written and sung. I found images of Greenham women wearing the most incredible handmade garments: sweaters with inscribed words, with Feminist emblems like labryses and fists. \r\n\r\nThrough studying these campers, I recognized that Creative Direct Action provides a powerful model for politically-inclined artists like myself—but unfortunately it is creative making that exists outside the purview of contemporary art.\r\nKR: What was the last indispensable show you saw and why?\r\n\r\nEL: When I was in Seattle over the holidays, I saw “Counter-Couture: Fashioning Identity in the American Counterculture” at the Bellevue Arts Museum. It presents a lot of the work from a book that I have been obsessed with for the last thirty years: “Native Funk and Flash: An Emerging Folk Art” (1974) by Alexandra Jacopetti, which showcased folk art by garment-makers in San Francisco at that time. The press for the show is gimmicky—like, look at these groovy artifacts of our youth—but the pieces themselves vibrate with revolutionary intentions.\r\nFor me, the show also expressed contemporary ideas. People can decide to make their clothes themselves, because they don’t want to wear garments manufactured in a factory with unfair labor conditions. People can still decide to wear something that sets them apart in public spaces—our daily, ideological battlegrounds. There is a lot of bravery in this setting yourself apart, in terms of gender nonconformity or in terms of simply  “opposing the program.”\r\nKR: How do you find your subjects?\r\n\r\nEL: I think I’ve bought every book and self-published pamphlet of the Greenham Commons Women’s Peace Camp that’s ever been printed. I also go through video and film archives and look for campers wearing garments which I can pattern. Last year, with the help of an “Artist as Activist” travel grant from the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, I went to a partial campers’ archive housed at the Women’s Library at the London School of Economics.\r\nOutside of the Greenham research, just following contemporary activism is very important for me. I have found subjects here in Portland at local Black Lives Matters and Occupy protests, and many on the internet as I read stories and watch videos that run concurrently with events.\r\nKR: What has been the most surprising response to your work?\r\n\r\nEL: The Brooklyn Museum has a piece of mine in their Elizabeth Sackler Collection that is a combination painting and sweater. The painting is framed and goes on the wall, and then the sweater is displayed on a shelf. The museum kept having to ask visitors to stop touching the sweater—one person had even picked it up and brought it to the museum’s Lost and Found. I loved that—it was such a clear indication that the sweater seems out of context in a museum show. To me, that proves its vitality.\r\nKR: What is art for? What does the best art do?\r\n\r\nEL: In an interview with Suzi Gablik in the book “Conversations Before the End of Time” (1997), the Performance Studies scholar Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett defines the artist’s role as one of turning “value into form.\" I love this idea, that art is the development of a symbolic visual language through which to argue one’s particular ethic. And I think this is what makes creativity effective, that creative components can take on an argumentative role.\r\nI personally agree with the Greenham Commons ethos as well, that creative making serves as a sort of opposition to violence: that it is an affirmation of life, of intention, of joy, of beauty.\r\nKR: What is the biggest challenge facing artists today?\r\nEL: Debt. I know too many young artists who finish undergraduate school with debts that exceed $100,000. They can’t afford a studio, let alone the opportunity to travel, to relocate, or to participate in the culture that they so value. I think debt closes the door on a lot of very dedicated, visionary young artists. And then some of these young artists with this debt still think that they should go to graduate school so that they can get a teaching job—as if that’s the endgame, or as if it’s 1990 and they weren’t just going to be used as adjuncts.\r\nKR: Who is your artistic hero?\r\n\r\nEL: Artists of the Feminist Art movement got me really excited to make things—I love Hannah Wilke, Sylvia Sleigh and Nancy Spero. I have also always been inspired by Joyce Kozloff and Miriam Shapiro of the Pattern and Decoration Movement, and by the women weavers of the Bauhaus. \r\n\r\nI love the work of Christina Ramberg, Diane Simpson, and Dorothy Iannone. Ramberg is obsessed with clothing items that have traditionally contorted the female body, like bras and corsets, and her paintings are intense reckonings with the power of female sexuality. Simpson\'s way of flattening and manipulating garment shapes is endlessly interesting to me.  And I love the sex-positivity of the female bodies in Iannone\'s work. Their sexualization is mythic—her women have round vulvas as big as testicles and they are manifesting her righteous, empowering texts.\r\nKR: What are you working on now?\r\nEL: I am completing work for a two-person show, with Helen Mirra, that opens in May at the Armory Center in Pasadena. I am also starting a new series of paintings that are modeled not from activist garments but from the garments of the female Amazon warriors on ancient Greek redware pottery. On these artifacts the Amazons are differentiated from Westerners by these garments, combination pant/tunics that are very heavily patterned. They are arguably some of the first depictions of “otherness,” and for sure of Eastern-ness in Western art. I think they are a fascinating subject right now, in the current political climate. \r\n\r\nI also have a web-based project at congratulationsandcelebrations.org through which anybody can check out a battle-axe motif sweater, sourced from Greenham Commons, to wear while performing a (self-defined) act of courage. There have been almost 50 renters since the project started in September, and you can follow the documentation on Instagram@congratulationsandcelebrations. Or you can check out the sweater yourself—I send it round trip, free of charge! \r\n\r\n\r\nARTSPACE, January 8, 2016\r\n\r\n\r\n',NULL),(263,1,'2017-09-01 16:26:58','2020-11-24 01:31:59',3,'Ellen Lesperance and Jeanine Oleson by Julia Bryan-Wilson',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'ellen-lesperance-and-jeanine-oleson-by-julia-bryan-wilson',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Ellen Lesperance and Jeanine Oleson by Julia Bryan-Wilson',_binary 'ELLEN LESPERANCE & JEANINE OLESON\r\nBY JULIA BRYAN-WILSON\r\n\r\n\r\nLegend has it that there is a video store in Portland, Oregon with a whole shelf dedicated to Bigfoot porn. Now what this porn might entail is a matter much of speculation: Do these videos depict Bigfoot doing it with men or women? Or is it Bigfoot-on-Bigfoot? Bigfoot orgies? But one need not travel all the way to Oregon to see a sexualized Saquatch, given the recent art world interest in yeti, humanoids and wild men. In September alone there was a Saquatch- themed group show at New York\'s Sixty Seven Gallery and an exhibition of Allyson Mitchell\'s “Lady Saquatch” project at Toronto\'s Paul Petro Gallery. Much of this work seems designed to titillate, even if that titillation is thinly disguised as derision.\r\n\r\nTaking a different tack on the apparently emerging genre of ‘Elusive Woodland Creature Art’ is the collaborative duo Ellen Lesperance and Jeanine Oleson\'s “Off the Grid.” Billed as “performance-based,” their large-scale photographs show the artists dressed (and undressed) as two characters—one a human woman in tattered knitwear, the other a naked, hairy she-critter—engaging in activities whose meanings remain obscure. In “Summer XIV” (2005), the woman, wearing a woolen bikini and wrist warmers, stands on a cliff overlooking the untamed ocean. Her upturned face receives a crimson line of blood that streams, alarmingly, and somewhat magically, from the sky.\r\n\r\nIn this piece, as in others, there is a tension between what is on-camera and off, between the action in the frame and the suggested apparatus that hovers just outside it. Because of this, the photos are ambivalent, and profoundly self-conscious, about their staginess. “Bigfoot & Nioka IV” (2005) captures the Sasquatch figure as she squats down in a clearing, clutching fistfuls of rock and dirt. Her hunched back is encrusted with filth and fur, yet the sun shines off her clean, smooth blonde hair.\r\n\r\nLesperance and Olseon are not interested in an archaic return to nature nor in a mokumentary-style “exposé,” but are ambiguous about the fantasy, longing and desire that mythic figures like Bigfoot elicit. Ancient rites are invoked without being explained. The two are shown after a kill in “Bigfoot & Nioka V” (2005), with a dripping cow\'s head, bloody hatchet and all, yet their faces betray both horror and confusion. In another photo sticks have been arranged around tree trunks, presumably by the creature that slinks off in the background.\r\n\r\nThe photographs evidence an interest in a contemporary fixation on place. Shot in locations like the Pacific Northwest and New Mexico, they nevertheless seem to exist in the space between somewhere and nowhere—a forest that is somehow too foresty, a stage set of a forest. Is there such a thing as primitive camp? Lesperance and Oleson mix deadpan humor and sly wit into their serious set of references to ethnography, feminism, and romanticized landscapes. By referring back to 1970s feminist performance that also made recourse to the naked body for political purposes, Lesperance and Oleson remind us that it might have also been funny-funny-sharp, funny-wise- to witness Carolee Schneeman outline herself in large messy brushstrokes (“Interior Scroll,” 1975), or see Judy Chicago\'s photo of a women removing a bloody tampon (“Red Flag,” 1971).\r\n\r\nIn “Bigfoot & Nioka III” (2003/05), the two characters recline a field of brilliant green grass. The grotesquely besmirched Bigfoot sprawls out- it is unclear if she is resting injured. A gold band on her ring finger glints among the matted fur and smeared mud. The human mountain mama, in her rags and feathers, and stockings, gazes down at Bigfoot. The look in her eyes is pure tenderness; if this is theater, it is theater as revelation. That expression transcends both the fetishization of and disgust for all this female flesh and hair and dirt and blood. Lesperance and Oleson push beyond the usual dichotomy of ridicule and sincerity, and suffuse their work with a humor that coexists with a genuine affective change.\r\n\r\n\r\nArtUS December 2005-February 2006\r\n\r\nExhibition review: Monya Rowe Gallery, New York, NY, September 8-October 8, 2005\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n',NULL),(264,1,'2018-01-15 16:29:39','2021-05-28 16:18:24',5,'#5 — Ellen Lesperance',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'ellen-lesperance',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								August 9 – November 5, 2017',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								<div>August 9 – November 5, 2017<br></div><div><br></div><div>The fifth season presents W.I.T.C.H. 1985, 2017 in collaboration with the <a href=\"https://portlandartmuseum.org\">Portland Art Museum</a>.\r\n<br><br>\r\nTHE SUBJECTS was on view as a Portland Art Museum project with Converge45.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nEllen Lesperance<br>\r\nW.I.T.C.H. 1985, 2017<br>\r\nPortland Art Museum, Jubitz Center for Modern and Contemporary Art, 4th Floor<br>\r\nAugust 9 - November 5, 2017\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"W.I.T.C.H. 1985\" is a sculptural installation and performative work comprising thirteen garments recreated from a scene in the 1985 made-for-television video called \"Can’t Beat It Alone\" which included footage from the Greenham Common Women’s Peace Camp, an all-woman, anti-nuke protest encampment (1982-2000.

Founded in 1968 in New York City, W.I.T.C.H. was a socialist feminist group which rallied for a range of leftist policies, and declared that:\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"If you are a woman and dare to look within yourself, you are a Witch. You make your own rules. You are free and beautiful. You can be invisible or evident in how you choose to make your witch-self known. You can form your own Coven of sister Witches (thirteen is a cozy number for a group) and do your own actions... You are a Witch by saying aloud, \'I am a Witch\' three times, and thinking about that. You are a Witch by being female, untamed, angry, joyous, and immortal.\"\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe cloaks are reproduced as accurately as possible and include embroidered and beaded components, and multiple silkscreen printed surfaces. The thirteen cloaks of Lesperance’s \"W.I.T.C.H. 1985\" can be re-activated in performative ways that return a sense of agency to the garment in the service of “untamed, angry, joyous, and immortal” actions.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWhen the garments were deinstalled in November, they were donated by the artist to the contemporary activist group WITCHPDX.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"W.I.T.C.H. 1985\" coincided with THE SUBJECTS, an exhibition and presentation of Lesperance’s novel, \"Peace Camps,\" and Greenham Common Women’s Peace Camp archival material. \"The Subjects\" was a project of Converge 45 in collaboration with the Portland Art Museum.\r\n<br><br><br>\r\n\r\nTHE SUBJECTS<br>\r\nPortland Art Museum, Crumpacker Family Library<br>\r\nAugust 9 - November 5, 2017\r\n<br><br>\r\nEllen Lesperance published her first novel \"Peace Camps\" in 2017, a novel partially set in the Greenham Common Women’s Peace Camp in Berkshire, England. The exhibition, titled \"The Subjects,\" features the book, published by the Portland arts press Container Corps with illustrations by Jeffry Mitchell, as well as archival photographs, source materials, and other texts linked to the all-woman, direct-action, anti-nuclear-proliferation occupation established outside the Greenham Common Royal Air Force base from 1982 until 2000.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLesperance invokes the work of female activists in her art; the Greenham Common Women’s Peace Camp and the rich archive of images of their campaign have long inspired her. Most notably in gridded paintings, Lesperance recreates the patterns, colors, and gauge of hand knit sweaters worn by the women in the camp. The garments communicated the wearer’s ideological intentions and Lesperance’s paintings serve a dual purpose: to assign valor to the woman who originally wore the sweater and to beckon a new wearer to pick up the fight for causes greater than themselves. The novel Peace Camps deepens her engagement with this historical source in new and provocative ways.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"The Subjects\" was on view at the Portland Art Museum in the Crumpacker Family Library on the second floor of the Mark Building Tuesday through Friday 10 a.m. – 4 p.m.</div>',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(265,1,'2018-01-15 16:31:17','2020-11-24 01:31:59',NULL,'Exhibition',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'exhibition',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Exhibition','',NULL),(267,1,'2018-01-15 16:35:05','2020-11-24 01:31:59',2,'Reading',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'reading',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Reading','',NULL),(268,0,'2018-01-15 16:35:31','2021-05-26 21:56:49',40,'Videos',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'videos',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '\r\n																								Videos',_binary '\r\n																								',_binary '\r\n																								'),(269,1,'2018-01-15 16:36:00','2020-11-24 01:31:59',4,'Images',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'images',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Images','',NULL),(270,1,'2018-01-15 16:43:08','2021-05-26 17:02:32',1,'Creative Direct Action: The Greenham Commons Women\'s Peace Camp 1981-2000',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'creative-direct-action-the-greenham-commons-women-s-peace-camp-1981-2000',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'By Ellen Lesperance',_binary 'When I met Nic, she was living on a feminist separatist commune in the hills outside of Santa Fe, New Mexico. It was well into the summer of 2005, and she was one of only four women in residence. I was there with friends to stage a photograph for an art project, and in return for our use of the land, I was to have my seven-months-pregnant belly painted with henna by Nic, who was interested in building her own portfolio. She had been trying to make a living selling homemade jewelry to tourists at the flea market, a formidable task when faced with crowds looking for cheap turquoise. This is where the henna idea comes in. My friends and I had brought in water and groceries for her but we ended up eating most of them because many were perishable and there was no electricity. Nic picked sage for us outside the back of her living structure and added it to browning butter cooked over a propane heater: sauce for some packaged ravioli. She had a desiccated lemon wedge stored above her sink that she offered us with the tea she served. She told us how much she was looking forward to a drive into the city later that day to take a hot bath at a friend’s place. She showed us how to use the pit bathroom out back, how to cover our waste with a handful of ash.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI was deeply affected by the strangeness of this setting: Nic the steward of a land lying dormant and scattered with the debris of an earlier era. There were still at least a dozen woman-built structures used for domiciles; they were small and in various stages of disrepair. One was an old delivery truck painted over all in turquoise, slivers of paint from its peeling windows were curling off and littering the ground. There were Styrofoam cooler parts and plastic water jugs littering the landscape, especially – due to the pitched incline of the acreage – collecting at the base of trees. There was the continual sound of tarps flapping in the wind. Nic’s house was one room, maybe ten by twelve feet, jutting out from the side of the hill. Inside, she had space enough for a double bed and a roller-top desk, a loaded bookcase and some elaborate shelving above a sink basin. For hours she sat beside me on her bed as she drew her elaborate design on my stomach, and in this time my mood became more and more downcast as I struggled to imagine what it might be like to live as Nic lived: marooned, susceptible, completely disenfranchised. I strained to understand Nic – who for her part seemed affable, undeterred, talkative. And it was Greenham Common that she wanted to discuss. Nic had come to this place after leaving Greenham Common.\r\n  <br><br>\r\nDuring the Cold War, the Greenham Common USAF/RAF Airbase was the location of the largest depository of nuclear “Cruise” missiles in Europe. Since the 1600s, these 1,200 acres of land had been reserved for common-use; for many citizens who had no private assets, it provided grounds for hunting, for gardening food reserves, for recreation and picnicking. It had, nevertheless, been utilized off and on by English troops throughout its extensive history. In times of peace, the acreage could be accessed and utilized, in times of war, this access was often revoked by the English military. In 1979, however, a decision was made in a secret NATO Headquarters meeting to convert the Greenham Common into an American airbase. In this closed-door meeting, the common was designated a more permanent role in the ongoing Cold War as it was earmarked for conversion into: one million tons of concrete and asphalt paving, twenty-one petroleum fuel stations, countless underground fueling tributaries, and storage holdings for ninety-six nuclear warheads, each with the capability to destroy a city a dozen times the size of Hiroshima. This was an era of an explicit understanding in Mutual Assured Destruction, M.A.D. If the U.S. struck, the Russians would retaliate, and they were likely to retaliate by bombing Greenham Common.\r\n <br><br>\r\nIn her 2004 essay, “Jailbirds I Have Loved,” Rebecca Solnit considers the contemporary feasibility of Thoreau-style civil disobedience in the U.S. and, instead of coming down predictably on the issue where one might expect in a post-Patriot Act era, she finds examples of stunningly effective recent protests: the shutting down of the 1999 WTO conference in Seattle, the continuing anti-military work of Code Pink, (and I would add, of course, any number of regional direct action campaigns that find against-the-odds successes). “If people could stand up to Pinochet,” she writes in her essay, “if the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo could march in Buenos Aires during the time of the generals, if people could speak up in Prague in the 1980s, we can here, far more than we do.” \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe idea of a “Euroshima” or a limited nuclear war that would be played out in a strictly European theater led to the deferment of hundreds of American nuclear missiles to Europe: to Greenham Common, to another English site in Molesworth, as well to sites in Sicily, West Germany, Holland and Belgium. These American military installations made it likely that it would be the English (or the Sicilians, or the West Germans) who would face the wrath of potential American aggression and not the Americans themselves. It is important to connect this Cold War-era occupation with current U.S. occupations and to recognize how our contemporaries in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in a very similar way have suddenly found themselves living in the target zones of an American War on Terror. In England in the early 1980s, 87% polled were sure they would not survive if a nuclear warhead was dropped on England and 49% thought this was indeed likely to happen (1). This population “was marked” by these installations: “If there is a nuclear war, I am sure I will die. I will either die from the initial blast, be vaporized or crushed, or I will die in the ensuing weeks from radiation sickness” (2). \r\n<br><br>\r\nThere is a constellation of reasons why I believe the Women’s Peace Camp that formed at Greenham Common should be brought into the light for further examination. Not the least of which is its ability to serve us as an inspirational and pertinent model right now. The question of this essay is whether that pertinent model can be both a civic model and an “artistic model.” In an article in the July/August 2010 issue of “Art Papers” entitled “From Artistic Activism to Geocritique,” theorist Brian Holmes laments: “We need a concept and a practice of transnational, cross-class collaboration that go way beyond the old ‘intellectuals and workers’ model, but manifestly, neither is available.” Indeed, this concept and practice is the legacy of many Creative Direct Action campaigns, and yet these activist histories fall outside of standard art discourse. A remarkable component of the camp that developed at Greenham Common was its reliance on visuals, primarily performative and sculptural display, to command the creative opposition that provided, in many cases, the backbone of these women’s efforts at civil disobedience. Creative Direct Action is a category of creative making that provides powerful models for politically-inclined artists, and offers a methodology that makes dissent visible in the public sphere. Contemporary Relational and Social Practice artists are afforded cultural cache for far less effective dissent practice. Is it worth our while to examine the vast creative projects that exist and have existed within activist campaigns? \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe beginnings of the Greenham Common Peace Camp began as a September 1981 march by a group of primarily Welsh activists calling themselves “Women for Peace on Earth.” They walked for seven days from Cardiff, Wales to the site to deliver a letter to the then-Secretary of the State of Defense, Francis Pym. In the letter, they called the arms race “the greatest threat ever faced by the human race and the living planet” and challenged him to a debate. Pym was dismissive and in fact invited the group to stay as long as they’d like. That is how a peace camp of nearly twenty years found its beginnings: an impassioned desire to communicate dissenting opinion being met with casual disregard. During this era, approximately twenty such camps were erected outside of military bases around the world. The ones in Seneca, NY and Kent, WA in 1983 are examples of more temporary U.S. installations, while the protest by the intrepid Concepcion Picciotto across from the White House in Washington D.C. is an example of one that continues to the present. These camps, and their nonviolent campaigns of direct action against the smooth functioning of the might of the military-industrial complex were effective in many ways, keeping the nuclear debate at the very forefront of local and international media coverage notwithstanding. \r\n<br><br>\r\nFor many women like Nic, the steadfast protagonist of this essay, there was no other moral choice but to head for one of these camps. Solnit again reminds us of Thoreau’s incantation against loss of faith in her aforementioned essay: “I say, break the law. Let your life be a counter-friction to stop the machine. What I have to do is to see, at any rate, that I do not lend myself to the wrong which I condemn.” And indeed, many first-hand accounts presented in the multiple small-press publications that came out of the Greenham camp attest to this sentiment: that there was no other ethical choice but to go. Women of all ages and walks of life made their way to the Greenham Common camp – including Green Peace activists, Miners’ Wives union groups, and a Manchester-based Prostitutes’ Collective – to unite under a common goal of pacifism. Many were self-identified mothers who were fearful of the world their children would inherit. Some traveled from afar to attend one of the camp-planned events, some were frequent visitors who would remain for short stints or stay weekends away from school, and then there were the women that made the Peace Camp their home for multiple years – Nic was one of these women. \r\n<br><br>\r\nAnd they were “all” women. After a debated but early decision, men were disallowed. They were barred for essentialist reasons, although it was an essentialism that history itself had done a very good job underscoring: that women did not have the aggressive social tendencies that brought about wars. Many early campers had accumulated experiences from prior activist campaigns, and had felt the strong arm of patriarchy present even under the most benevolent of campaigns. Camper Leslie Boulton in “Greenham Women Everywhere” explains: “They find that it’s a very bureaucratic set-up, invariably run by blokes... We all sit down and we are informed and we find ourselves talking to the backs of each other’s heads... I want to express what I’m feeling, but there’s no space for me to do it.” These women did not want a male spokesperson for their cause, one they saw as, in part, a TAKE THE TOYS FROM THE BOYS-style direct confrontation against the masculinity of the military industrial complex. They wanted to band together to support one another in an expression that they considered to be more caring, more nurturing, of one another and towards the history of the planet.  \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe women who collected at the base were there to upset the smooth functioning of the military compound in its zeal to convert itself into a nuclear holding facility. Around-the-clock residence at the site enabled the women to closely watch the activities on the base and organize themselves to mobilize the appropriate disruptions. By the end of 1983, nine distinct campgrounds or “gates” were established around the nine-mile periphery of the Greenham air base, distributing the campers to all reaches for observation. These gates were named for the colors of the rainbow and each had distinctive attributes and populations that made them more or less desirable to any new camper. Nic recounted to me the way that women who were new to the premises would undergo a sort of social typecasting to ensure that they “fit in” where they decided to make camp. And it is interesting to note the various sub-categories of leftists that she identified to me as she made clear that the vegan anarchists preferred to consort with their own (at the Turquoise Gate), as did the hippies, as did the intellectuals, as did the population of campers that she labeled specifically as “the flag burners.”\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe campsites themselves were ramshackle and ever changing. Evictions of campers and the early-morning destruction of campgrounds began early on, as it was decided by the local authorities in the Newbury District Council that no permanent structures were to be allowed. This meant that sleeping, eating and protecting oneself from the elements – all basic human needs – came with extreme difficulty. A type of structure called a “bender” was born of the need for impermanent shelter. Still attentive of the pacifist ethic to do no harm, live sapling trees were not harvested but simply bent over and securely weighted to the ground, providing the framework required for overlays of tarp, canvas and plastic sheeting. These were low to the ground, burrow-like, and typically large enough to house one or two women. Other shelters consisted of tarps hung over clothing lines to create rudimentary tents. These provided some protection from the elements but very huddled sleeping quarters. \r\n<br><br>\r\nTo get at the quality of life at Greenham, the remarkable contrast between the opposite sides of the fence needs to be imagined. For many, the vast military compound – its austere, stripped landscape, its behemoth architectural structures, the mechanics of its orderly operations, its uniformed population of trained soldiers – is possibly the easier of the two sides to conceptualize. To call to mind the other, one must do one’s best to envision a fully outdoor encampment housing potentially hundreds of women that was in the process of being made up anew every few days. Imagine the litter, the wind-tossed debris, the piles of sacked trash, the accumulating residue of past shelters, the unidentified belongings. Imagine the perennial dampness and the layer of plastic sheeting draped on and underneath absolutely everything. Here and there, folding tables were erected and covered with the food that had been donated or scraped together for the week: loaves of sliced bread knotted shut against bugs and the weather, jars of peanut butter and preserves, powered milk, a water-filled basin for washing. Clothing lines hanging heavy with sopping fabrics were strung from every intermittent tree that wasn’t already being used to create shelter. The campfire was central and typically had a tripod erected above it from which an oversized cooking pot hung. This is where the standard fare was cooked: porridge, curried lentils. This was where a kettle boiled water for tea. \r\n<br><br>\r\nOne theme that repeatedly surfaces in the literature coming out of this camp was the theme of “not knowing” – not knowing if a Red Alert was an exercise or if in fact a catastrophe was eminent, not knowing if the warheads on the road were in transport or if they had been deployed. This lack of security created an ongoing, palpable anxiety for these women that functioned powerfully as a window out through the layers of apathy that had once immobilized them. No longer were geopolitical issues to be debated abstractly. A lifestyle was maintained that enabled them to feel the veracity of the fact that they were under direct nuclear threat, that they could be killed – at any instant – and that everything that they loved would be killed along with them. They managed to implicate their survival instincts, and at that point it was impossible to remain passive.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAll direct action was nonviolent, and relied upon the women courageously putting their bodies on the line. This presented a physical reality that the authorities struggled to respond to: hundreds, sometimes thousands, of defenseless female bodies and the attentive media nearby. In 1983, when the first of the cruise missile convoys started appearing at the base (these convoys would continue for seven years until 1990), trucks would enter and leave the airbase virtually every day. Every day provided another opportunity for protest: the laying of one’s body down upon the roads, the disruption of the assembling of pipeline, protest against the transportation of plutonium along the countryside’s roads, the disruption of military exercises, Creative Direct Action campaigns.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn the regrettably still relevant 1895 Charlotte Perkins Gilman short story “An Unnatural Mother,” a gathering of fictional townsfolk repeatedly maligns Gilman’s protagonist, Esther Greenwood. Esther, the child of a widower, is represented as out of conformance with the array of social forces that would have shaped her into a proper young lady. Seemingly, this divergence caused her to do the unthinkable in Gilman’s story: warn the villagers of an imminent dam break before rescuing her own infant son from his crib. To the reader, Esther is indeed the most ethical of heroines, singularly responsible for the survival of three villages of people. By the rescued, however, she remains spited for proving no aptitude to her appropriate duties. Likewise, the media attention showered upon the women who took up the cause at the airbase was stereotypical and far less than favorable (“harridans” and “a fairly gruesome bunch” in “The Spectator,” “burly lesbians” in “The Sun”), as was the response from many of the local citizens whom the Greenham campers were indeed looking to forewarn and protect (3). In the nearby town of Newbury, posters advertising vigilante groups forming ‘against’ the women were posted. These groups destroyed and threw feces and blood onto the women’s campsites; they threatened to disable the local standpipes the women relied upon for water. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThis animosity serves to remind us of the power of direct political intervention. In her 2007 essay “Artistic Activism and Agonistic Spaces,” Belgian political theorist Chantal Mouffe presents her ‘agonistic model’ and persuades us that public space (such as the space that surrounded the Greenham airbase) is an ideological “battleground” that gives rise to a particular type of conflict: conflict that she recognizes as ‘the necessary factor’ for a working, thriving democracy. In her article, Mouffe values the way that many art practices are aimed at challenging dominant hegemonies and accomplishing the kind of agonistic affront she champions. She argues that “[what] is needed is widening the field of artistic intervention, by intervening directly in a multiplicity of social spaces in order to oppose the program of total social mobilization of capitalism.” It is hard to confront this theoretical model and not be moved to better consider the activist-oriented spaces where Creative Direct Action has thrived. These are not art actions in art spaces but better conjure up picket lines, human blockades, banner drops, student occupations, and street theater performances. Work like that of Code Pink, with their stories-tall “pink slip” banner drops. Work like the graphic BP = BAD PEOPLE signage that infiltrated a live congressional press conference and ended up on the front page of “The New York Times” (May 11, 2010), or the concrete use of real, dripping oil on recent spill disaster protest banners. Work like that of the Greenham campers.  \r\n<br><br>\r\nIt is evident that the women at Greenham were questioning the dominant hegemony, and that their critique was totalizing and covered everything from the vast ethics of nation states to the smaller ethics of partnering with other individuals and with the land. Interestingly, they were not always most maligned for their disruption of the military installation as much as for their transgressive affront to a much broader net of commonplace societal expectations: their lack of “femininity,” their sexual preferences, the fact that they frequently shaved their heads (a practical tactic given the circumstances), their public breastfeeding (although other mothers, like Gilman’s Esther Greenwood, had left their children behind, and either solution to mothering was seen as inappropriate), the slogans they wore on their bodies, the disarray of their campsites. Here was a lack of regard for the sorts of measures that one takes in a public space to display one’s compliance with a shared symbolic order. A transgressive disavowal was at play, niceties melted away, and, in comparison to the obscene display of military wealth represented by the new air base installation, squalor developed on the other side of the dividing fence. When I met Nic on the hillside commune in New Mexico, its destitution struck me as a marker that its idealism had faltered, and indeed this is a commonplace reflection that I hear made by those who visit communes still extant from past decades: that they are disorderly, that they are squalid and impoverished. Yet, in reevaluation, these challenges to delicate status quo sensibilities seem to prove quite the ‘opposite’ of faltering ideological commitments. \r\n<br><br>\r\nAs I have discussed, the women at Greenham faced incredible hardships. They were frightened, angry, and uncomfortable. Many were arrested and served multiple prison sentences (primarily for, of all things, “causing a breach of peace”). Nevertheless, they stayed. Many were convinced that the more protest activity they generated, the more ‘visible’ their dissent would become; this, they believed, would rattle other women around the world from the sanctuary of their passivity. This need to make ‘visible’ is a sort of a call for visuals. In an interview with Suzi Gablik in “Conversations Before the End of Time” (1997), Performance Studies scholar Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett defines the artist’s role as one of turning “value into form.” Indeed this was the practice at play at these camps: developing a symbolic visual language through which to argue their particular ethic. In many cases the protest actions gained their effectiveness through the creative components, as these components continued their argumentative role when reproduced as images in the press.  \r\n<br><br>\r\nThere was a type of visual language established at the camp that was specific both in its aesthetics and specific in its use of metaphoric symbolism. Of all other potential symbols to be claimed for meaning, these women selected two that were most frequently utilized in the service of their protest: the ‘snake’ and the ‘web.’ Both provided subtle but perfectly apt metaphoric language for the struggles they were facing. The snake is an animal that outgrows its skin and needs to entirely shed that encasement in order to move forward with its life. The lesson for humankind inherent in the use of this symbol was, for these women, a platform from which an event like their February 7, 1983 action grew. This action was staged on a day that the Secretary of State for Defense was visiting from Newbury. Three snake “costumes” were utilized that had been created from cloth yardage and sheeting. Each snake was long enough for approximately thirty women to crawl within, and together the approximately one hundred women removed some of the bolts from the bottom of the base’s perimeter fence to allow for their low, undetected entrance. One snake was able to “slither” the entire length of the compound before being forced off. Clearly, an action such as this develops meaning around a self-identified symbolic order, as, at the same time, it is a visible dissenting action ‘and’ calls attention to the security of a nuclear holding facility. On June 25th of the same year, an additional version of this event was enacted, only that time with 2000 women and a snake that grew to be over ‘four miles long.’\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe ‘web’ provided an additional metaphor that was highly utilized in the service of political self-identity. Within a web, each singular strand is a tentative, delicate thing. However, the network of interdependence achieved, the strength of the whole, would never belie this. The spider, as well, is willing to spin and repair this network tirelessly. Weaving woolen webs around the camp was the single-most common creative act at Greenham. Web stringing was also utilized as a tactic for complicating access by the military and police to certain sites of protest. Jane Lockwood, a camper that kept a diary of her time at the camp explains: “we occupied the site where they wanted to begin digging... For an hour about 20 of us wove a huge web of wool and string across the whole area. We entangled ourselves in it, some women sat amongst the threads, others lay beneath it” (4). Additionally, woolen webbing that some campers associated with the practice of darning was commonly woven into the perimeter fencing to call attention to its damaged areas, the breaches in its security. This tactic, however temperate it may seem, is repeatedly represented in reports as having been particularly inflaming to soldiers. \r\n<br><br>\r\nMultiple web-centered events also transpired within the camps. New Years Day, 1984, is represented by an especially grandiose action in which a spectacularly huge web was first “spun” and then connected to hundreds of helium-filled balloons that lifted the structure to float suspended above the base. It is reported that there had been additional discussion by campers to fill those balloons with bits of tinfoil to prove how easily the base’s radar system could be dismantled; but this lesson was decided to potentially endanger more than it safeguarded. \r\n<br><br>\r\nA camper quoted in “Greenham Common: Women at the Wire” describes what the creative spirit of the camps looked like in 1983: “Today we got up to a bit of bother to put it lightly. We’ve been painting rocks with beautiful things; we’ve made signs and written words with them but it has to be seen to be believed.” Time in wait of activity on base was typically at hand, so the knitting of water-repellant wearables, the creation of signage, the painting and arranging of rocks, and the decoration of surfaces was quite commonplace. Video footage and photographs from the site document symbolic usage that extended far beyond snake and web imagery. Within the aesthetics of this camp and its actions, a veritable women’s history of symbol usage was at play. There were sweaters with knit-in ideological symbolism: double (labrys) axes, phoenixes, rainbows, anarchy signs, and women’s liberation movement fists. There were the “painted canvas” exteriors of the benders, many featuring goddess portraiture, landscape paintings and celestial maps. There were sheet music transcriptions of Greenham rallying songs and musicians playing in accompaniment: “Here we sit, here we stand, here we claim the Common Land. Their arms shall not command. Bring the message home.” There were women who performed extended “keening” sessions whereby they stood together and loudly wailed and cried out in lament. There were protest signs made on sheets and fabric yardage, and sometimes these were sewn together to create miles-long processions. And so it was “No Euroshima” embroidered in black on a ground of marigold floral that begat NO MISSILES IN EUROPE with the O in NO turned into an universal woman symbol that begat an appliqué black crescent moon on a ground of red starbursts that begat a left to right peace dove ascension that begat a painted depiction of people of all nationalities interlocking hands around the surface of the earth, and so on, and so forth.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe base’s peripheral fencing was additionally repurposed to transcend mere barrier designation and instead provide a surface for the display of every last cherish-able object that the campers held in their possessions: children’s clothing and toys, photographs of loved ones, letters from home and from supporters. There were, of course, the lovingly darned areas. There was an endless supply of abandoned scrap plastic that could be cut into various colored strips or rolled, knotted taut, and used as “fabric” to create woven designs in the fencing. There were expanses that were camouflaged natural with foliage and Christmas evergreen. There were elaborate cut paper installations and signage that pled, in hundreds of different ways, for peace. Chris Mulvey, a camper who came to the camps from Dublin, spoke of the perimeter fence not as a barricade but as “a womyn’s collage of life” (5).\r\n<br><br>\r\nMany of the first-hand accounts by the women who lived on the base described a recognition that befell them: that the act of ‘creatively changing something’ was a sort of an opposite of violence. Many saw creativity itself as a gesture of anti-violence. Creative Direct Action is the already extant term for the visual accompaniments that coexist alongside many activist campaigns. According to the forest defense movement’s The Ruckus Society and their self-published and freely downloadable “Creative Direct Action Visuals” (2007), these projects additionally “unify your group, amplify your message, invite people to have a personal interaction with your work, and provide a visual story through symbols that clarify the issue.” In this handbook, The Ruckus Society asks that the artist/activist creating visuals considers the site of her action when considering its scale and the appropriate medium. They advise that a message is kept “short and sweet” and that it is tested out “on a lot of people before you commit” to “[m]ake sure it makes sense to your target audience and to the general public, and not just insiders.” This insistence on clear, unequivocal messaging is what, I believe, keeps Creative Direct Action on the periphery of art discourse while, at the same time, it provides the strategy that makes the work effective. \r\n<br><br>\r\nIn “Greenham Common: Women at the Wire,” Babs Schmidt, a camper and drama student from Germany, recounts a Hiroshima Day Creative Direct Action event staged on August 6, 1982 which demonstrates the effectiveness of such clear messaging. First, she and other campers collected 100,000 stones. Each stone represented one of the 100,000 people killed during the first instant the bomb dropped on the city of Hiroshima in 1945. These stones were brought to Newbury’s war memorial, a WWII monument that read “For the Glory of the Dead.” The women bravely stood beside the heap of rocks asking of the townspeople, over and over again: “This is one person’s life, do you want to honor it by placing it with the others?” Because of the clarity of this action, Schmidt reported she was slapped in the face by a war veteran, screamed at by a woman whose husband had died in the war, and spat upon.\r\n<br><br>\r\nClaire Bishop’s 2006 “Artforum” article “The Social Turn: Collaboration and Its Discontents” cites the “mixed panorama of socially collaborative work” as today’s artistic avant-garde. In these relational practices, collaboration between the artist/author and the audience is initiated (and in so doing making those very terms obsolete) and the atmosphere of democratic community-making is, in many instances, the construction. In many cases, these are controlled micro-utopias wherein it might be imagined that a palliative social encounter can cause some (albeit temporary) alignment to befall the community. Clearly, a social conscience is at play (although at odds with Mouffe’s ‘agonistic model’). In the Pacific Northwest, where I live and where a beacon Art and Social Practice MFA program is housed at Portland State University (PSU), food-based events are very common Social Practice events, as food provides a sort of baseline connectivity, whether it be initializing new micro-economies for food exchange, designing specialty beers for museum-goers, providing exposure to regional foods, or educating around ecological sustainability concerns. In these projects, social practitioners (artists) will often align themselves with grassroots activist traditions and specific political causes, even while imagining that what they are doing is activistic but ‘different’ than activism. \r\n<br><br>\r\nA program such as PSU’s, which offers a concentration in Social Practice within its MFA, is not alone in offering a student an expensive degree in this growing field (there is another at the California College of the Arts, another at Carnegie Mellon). This access to cultural capital is denied to standard Creative Direct Action activists. The effect of this castigation is twofold. Not only does it sweep aside the creative merit of what they do, but, to my mind, it participates in the suppression of dissent messaging by denying coverage. During the protests at Greenham, it could be certain that depriving the women of media attention deprived them of cultural capitol because what they did – regardless of its scale, regardless of its creative excellence – was rendered invisible. Nic spoke to me about how, years into the activities at the air base, brazen, unchecked civil disobedience was adapted to confront this suppression. To provoke a response, bold actions like the July 25, 1983 base break-in were planned during which seven brave women did an estimated 2.5 million pounds of painted-peace-symbol damage to the U.S. Air Force’s (then) most elite spy plane, the U.S. Blackbird. So wary was the military of revealing its vulnerability, or – through media coverage – of indirectly inviting more women to join the cause, that the women were never reprimanded. \r\n<br><br>\r\nWhat gives a practice cultural cache? Unfortunately, in her 2004 “October” essay “Antagonism and Relational Aesthetics,” Claire Bishop is willing to dismiss the activistic realm of relational practice as the realm that fails to produce works of merit. In it she writes: “I am not suggesting that relational art works need to develop a greater social conscience – by making pinboard works about international terrorism, for example, or giving free curries to refugees.” For her the criteria for success within relational practices is ultimately an ‘aesthetic’ criteria to be enforced and not, as Creative Direct Action campaigners would have it, linked to a project’s ability to confront a social goal (6). Moreover, the aesthetic criterion that she ultimately lists maintains a surprising attachment to an artistic tradition of obscured intentionality. For example, she asks that relational works “scuttle between sense and nonsense” and “allow multiple interpretations” (7). Santiago Sierra, one of the relational artists that consistently makes Bishop’s cut, can, in a piece such as “Laborers Who Cannot Be Paid, Remunerated to Remain in the Interior of Carton Boxes” (2000), therefore speak broadly about exploitation and capitalism with his audience at a contemporary art venue in Berlin while at the same time preserving a tension between hidden Chechen refugee bodies and a perverted, Donald Judd-like presentation.\r\n<br><br>\r\nTo my mind, to assign cultural cache to relational works that allow for “multiple interpretations” is to imagine that political directness has little place in Bishop’s contemporary avant-garde. “I can’t change anything,” is Sierra’s working ethos. “There is no possibility that we can change anything with our artistic work. We do our work because we are making art, and because we believe art should be something that follows reality. But I don’t believe in the possibility of change” (8). In his 2008 novel “Diary of a Bad Year,” J.M Coetzee, Nobel Prize-winning South African author, echoes Sierra’s conclusions through the voice of his protagonist, Señor C, a man who compiles short essay responses to various issues of controversy. Under the subject heading “On Guantanamo Bay” Señor C writes: “Someone should put together a ballet under the title “Guantanamo, Guantanamo”! In describing this ballet, the protagonist imagines the type of restrictive costuming that might be designed for the troupe of dancer-prisoners and the regalia and prop weaponry that might accompanying the troupe of dancer-guards as well as the orchestration of movements a choreographer might find appropriate to each constituency. (He also thinks to include in his production a leading role for Donald Rumsfeld.) But as arresting and apt such a work of art might become, as popular and potentially global as its run might prove to be, Coetzee concludes: “It will have absolutely no effect on the people it targets, who could care less what ballet audiences think of them.” Although Coetzee’s critique is written under the protective umbrella of fiction, it nonetheless joins Sierra in offering a stark indictment on the value of what we ‘as artists’ can do politically. \r\n<br><br>\r\nWhen is art with political messaging pertinent? How can art truly do what Mouffe asks of it: “foment dissensus... make visible what the dominant consensus tends to obscure and obliterate” (9)? Is it possible that Sierra’s “I can’t change anything” motivational credo is a luxury maintained by politically rankling an esoteric arts audience? Surely there are polemical discussions suitable to be art, the Feminist Art Movement provides interesting examples of such projects. In terms of context, here was political struggle that was ‘suitably art’ because much of the redress that was sought was art-based. Many radically confrontational works were designed to express art-based dissent, both in content and in form (think of the Pattern and Decoration movement): to agitate arts institutions, art markets, and the very narratives and mediums that underscored value within its frameworks. Lorraine O’Grady, participant artist in this year’s Whitney Biennial, for example, is possibly best known for developing Mlle Bourgeoise Noire, a character she produced to confront the segregated 1980s art world. Crashing art events and openings wearing a dress made up of tiers of white gloves, she spat out protest messages and recriminations. In many cases, the raw, direct aesthetics and the tactics employed by artists and artist collectives such as The Guerilla Girls, Suzanne Lacy and Leslie Labowitz, Women’s Action Coalition, and Feminist Art Workers, make this work indiscernible from Creative Direct Action. And yet, we as artists make our acquaintance with ‘these’ histories. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe Greenham Common was eventually returned to the public in the late winter of 2000. First to go was the perimeter fence, and although it opened the acreage to the populace, no longer was the common what it once was. For example, it took five years for its poured concrete and asphalt paving to be broken apart and hauled away (including all the material from Greenham’s boasted “longest runway in Europe”). Almost two-dozen fuel stations and their adjoining systems of pipelines also needed to be dismantled, and, in doing so, many were discovered to have leaked. Hundreds of thousands of cubic meters of this polluted soil, too expensive to landfill, needed to be aerated (10). The Women’s Peace Camp closed the same year, nineteen years after the September 5, 1981 march by the “Women for Life on Earth” group, and nearly a decade after the end of the Cold War. The last action by the group was the securing of a memorial on the site that commemorated the political activity of the camp and the women who had dedicated themselves to it. Known as New Greenham Park, this memorial includes two commemorative sculptures and a garden planted for Helen Thomas, a young Greenham camper who was killed by a police vehicle in 1989.\r\n  <br><br>\r\nI think about the sort of bestowal that occurred when Nic shared with me her story and traced symbolic outlines upon my pregnant belly. I wish that, at the time, I had known the history of Greenham Common and had not instead further marginalized such an indomitable woman with the insult of my blank-faced unfamiliarity. My son is five now, he’s into superheroes, and upon watching the terrifying back-story of the infant Superman, he will from time to time ask: “Mom, will our planet ever be on fire?” I don’t know what to say in those instances, when to hope and to wish with profound reserve that the answer is “no” is not to provide an answer. Keeping alive a tradition of ecological consciousness is one thing, but as Barry Sanders points out in his devastating 2009 book “The Green Zone: The Environmental Costs of Militarism”: bike to work as much as you can, reuse and recycle, but it’s military activity that is by far the single largest pollution source in the world – from innumerable exploding chemical bombs to unthinkable amounts of fuel consumption, to the literal littering of nations with depleted uranium detritus. “I know lots of people try to push this into the back of their minds, but I think it is getting harder to keep it there now,” writes a Greenham camper known only as Mrs. Smith in the edited collection of first-hand accounts “Greenham Women Everywhere.” “I’m sure most people are getting the feeling that we are heading towards some dreadful calamity.” There is, of course, urgent work to be done. As politically inclined artists, we need to select the methods by which we might best, in Mouffe’s words, “oppose the program.” \r\n<br><br>\r\nOn December 11, 1983, pre-cell phone, previous to ready access to the Internet and our present-day assortment of available hand-held computer devices, the women at Greenham Common were able – through initiating grassroots activist tactics: telephone trees, vast letter writing campaigns, leaflet distribution, radio announcements, word-of-mouth persuasion – to gather an estimated ‘35,000 women’ at the air base for its second annual encircle-the-base event. On this occasion, it was decided that the symbolic use of mirrors be employed, and metaphorically for that afternoon, these women contained the evil of the air base within their grasp of hands. They forced it to reflect back upon itself, and forced the watching world to themselves confront such reflection. An action such as this might epitomize the agency of a creative act, and in learning of its example, we allow its message to resonate.\r\n<br><br>\r\nMarch 2011\r\n<br><br>\r\nNOTES\r\n<br><br>\r\n   1.

But behind their intimations of warmth and coziness are stirring calls to action. The Minneapolis-born artist (who shows at Adams and Ollman  in Portland, where she is now based, and Ambach and Rice in Los Angeles) finds her source material in the archives of Feminist activist groups and at contemporary protests (such as those affiliated with \"Black Lives Matter\" and the \"Occupy\" movement).<br>\r\nIn an interview for Artspace\'s \"Meet the Artist\" series, Lesperance gave Karen Rosenberg some essential background on her life and work.\r\n<br><br>\r\nKAREN ROSENBERG: How did you first get involved with art?\r\n<br><br>\r\nELLEN LESPERANCE: My mom was in charge of crafts at this miserable Christian camp that I had to go as a child, and I think my creative impulses have some relationship to this: to ducking out of Bible school to go hang out in the craft closet. I don’t have memories of a time when I wasn’t involved in making something with my hands.\r\n<br><br>\r\nKR: What other childhood experiences shaped you as an artist?\r\n<br><br>\r\nEL: I come from a really big mixed-race family in the early 1970s in the Midwest—my mom had five kids, adopted three kids, lost two kids. My closest sister is black. People on the street and kids at school called us names, and my family got kicked out of restaurants. I got into verbal and physical fights as early as I can remember. I grew up with raw, tangible feelings regarding inequity and what it means to fight for justice.\r\n<br><br>\r\nKR: What did you learn from art school?\r\n<br><br>\r\nEL: As an undergraduate I was a pretty straightforward figurative painter in a very traditional program. It wasn’t until graduate school that I really got into the visual vocabulary of knitting: its not-square but grid-based formatting, the conventions of its pattern layouts, its language for writing a pattern—American Symbolcraft. I have been working with that vocabulary for twenty years, knowing, loving, that it has implicit limitations and that it\'s inherently Feminist: because women knit, because the history of handiwork is a woman’s history.\r\n<br><br>\r\nKR: What were some important things that you learned outside of art school?\r\n<br><br>\r\nEL: When I graduated from undergraduate art school in Seattle in 1995, I found a union job as a city bus driver for METRO transit. I was really good at my job, but I was also constantly harassed by my coworkers—I was working out of a base that had very few female drivers. I started knitting what I see now as power objects that I would wear under my uniform: things that would change the shape of my body.\r\n<br><br>\r\nKR: Can you describe a pivotal moment in the development of your work?\r\n<br><br>\r\nEL: In 2005, I met a woman in a small Feminist-separatist commune in the hills outside of Santa, Fe, New Mexico. She had been a long-term camper at an all-woman, anti-nuke protest site called Greenham Commons in England in the 1980s, and she told me a few stories. I learned that a remarkable component of the camp was its reliance on Creative Direct Action. The campers\' tents were heavily decorated, the razor wire fencing surrounding the base was adorned, elaborate performances were staged, songs were written and sung. I found images of Greenham women wearing the most incredible handmade garments: sweaters with inscribed words, with Feminist emblems like labryses and fists. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThrough studying these campers, I recognized that Creative Direct Action provides a powerful model for politically-inclined artists like myself—but unfortunately it is creative making that exists outside the purview of contemporary art.\r\n<br><br>\r\nKR: What was the last indispensable show you saw and why?\r\n<br><br>\r\nEL: When I was in Seattle over the holidays, I saw “Counter-Couture: Fashioning Identity in the American Counterculture” at the Bellevue Arts Museum. It presents a lot of the work from a book that I have been obsessed with for the last thirty years: “Native Funk and Flash: An Emerging Folk Art” (1974) by Alexandra Jacopetti, which showcased folk art by garment-makers in San Francisco at that time. The press for the show is gimmicky—like, look at these groovy artifacts of our youth—but the pieces themselves vibrate with revolutionary intentions.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFor me, the show also expressed contemporary ideas. People can decide to make their clothes themselves, because they don’t want to wear garments manufactured in a factory with unfair labor conditions. People can still decide to wear something that sets them apart in public spaces—our daily, ideological battlegrounds. There is a lot of bravery in this setting yourself apart, in terms of gender nonconformity or in terms of simply  “opposing the program.”\r\n<br><br>\r\nKR: How do you find your subjects?\r\n<br><br>\r\nEL: I think I’ve bought every book and self-published pamphlet of the Greenham Commons Women’s Peace Camp that’s ever been printed. I also go through video and film archives and look for campers wearing garments which I can pattern. Last year, with the help of an “Artist as Activist” travel grant from the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, I went to a partial campers’ archive housed at the Women’s Library at the London School of Economics.\r\n<br><br>\r\nOutside of the Greenham research, just following contemporary activism is very important for me. I have found subjects here in Portland at local Black Lives Matters and Occupy protests, and many on the internet as I read stories and watch videos that run concurrently with events.\r\n<br><br>\r\nKR: What has been the most surprising response to your work?\r\n<br><br>\r\nEL: The Brooklyn Museum has a piece of mine in their Elizabeth Sackler Collection that is a combination painting and sweater. The painting is framed and goes on the wall, and then the sweater is displayed on a shelf. The museum kept having to ask visitors to stop touching the sweater—one person had even picked it up and brought it to the museum’s Lost and Found. I loved that—it was such a clear indication that the sweater seems out of context in a museum show. To me, that proves its vitality.\r\n<br><br>\r\nKR: What is art for? What does the best art do?\r\n<br><br>\r\nEL: In an interview with Suzi Gablik in the book “Conversations Before the End of Time” (1997), the Performance Studies scholar Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett defines the artist’s role as one of turning “value into form.\" I love this idea, that art is the development of a symbolic visual language through which to argue one’s particular ethic. And I think this is what makes creativity effective, that creative components can take on an argumentative role.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI personally agree with the Greenham Commons ethos as well, that creative making serves as a sort of opposition to violence: that it is an affirmation of life, of intention, of joy, of beauty.\r\n<br><br>\r\nKR: What is the biggest challenge facing artists today?\r\n<br><br>\r\nEL: Debt. I know too many young artists who finish undergraduate school with debts that exceed $100,000. They can’t afford a studio, let alone the opportunity to travel, to relocate, or to participate in the culture that they so value. I think debt closes the door on a lot of very dedicated, visionary young artists. And then some of these young artists with this debt still think that they should go to graduate school so that they can get a teaching job—as if that’s the endgame, or as if it’s 1990 and they weren’t just going to be used as adjuncts.\r\n<br><br>\r\nKR: Who is your artistic hero?\r\n<br><br>\r\nEL: Artists of the Feminist Art movement got me really excited to make things—I love Hannah Wilke, Sylvia Sleigh and Nancy Spero. I have also always been inspired by Joyce Kozloff and Miriam Shapiro of the Pattern and Decoration Movement, and by the women weavers of the Bauhaus. \r\n<br><br>\r\nI love the work of Christina Ramberg, Diane Simpson, and Dorothy Iannone. Ramberg is obsessed with clothing items that have traditionally contorted the female body, like bras and corsets, and her paintings are intense reckonings with the power of female sexuality. Simpson\'s way of flattening and manipulating garment shapes is endlessly interesting to me.  And I love the sex-positivity of the female bodies in Iannone\'s work. Their sexualization is mythic—her women have round vulvas as big as testicles and they are manifesting her righteous, empowering texts.\r\n<br><br>\r\nKR: What are you working on now?\r\n<br><br>\r\nEL: I am completing work for a two-person show, with Helen Mirra, that opens in May at the Armory Center in Pasadena. I am also starting a new series of paintings that are modeled not from activist garments but from the garments of the female Amazon warriors on ancient Greek redware pottery. On these artifacts the Amazons are differentiated from Westerners by these garments, combination pant/tunics that are very heavily patterned. They are arguably some of the first depictions of “otherness,” and for sure of Eastern-ness in Western art. I think they are a fascinating subject right now, in the current political climate. \r\n<br><br>\r\nI also have a web-based project at congratulationsandcelebrations.org through which anybody can check out a battle-axe motif sweater, sourced from Greenham Commons, to wear while performing a (self-defined) act of courage. There have been almost 50 renters since the project started in September, and you can follow the documentation on Instagram@congratulationsandcelebrations.

Now what this porn might entail is a matter much of speculation: Do these videos depict Bigfoot doing it with men or women? Or is it Bigfoot-on-Bigfoot? Bigfoot orgies? But one need not travel all the way to Oregon to see a sexualized Saquatch, given the recent art world interest in yeti, humanoids and wild men. In September alone there was a Saquatch- themed group show at New York\'s Sixty Seven Gallery and an exhibition of Allyson Mitchell\'s “Lady Saquatch” project at Toronto\'s Paul Petro Gallery. Much of this work seems designed to titillate, even if that titillation is thinly disguised as derision.\r\n<br><br>\r\nTaking a different tack on the apparently emerging genre of ‘Elusive Woodland Creature Art’ is the collaborative duo Ellen Lesperance and Jeanine Oleson\'s “Off the Grid.” Billed as “performance-based,” their large-scale photographs show the artists dressed (and undressed) as two characters—one a human woman in tattered knitwear, the other a naked, hairy she-critter—engaging in activities whose meanings remain obscure. In “Summer XIV” (2005), the woman, wearing a woolen bikini and wrist warmers, stands on a cliff overlooking the untamed ocean. Her upturned face receives a crimson line of blood that streams, alarmingly, and somewhat magically, from the sky.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn this piece, as in others, there is a tension between what is on-camera and off, between the action in the frame and the suggested apparatus that hovers just outside it. Because of this, the photos are ambivalent, and profoundly self-conscious, about their staginess. “Bigfoot &amp; Nioka IV” (2005) captures the Sasquatch figure as she squats down in a clearing, clutching fistfuls of rock and dirt. Her hunched back is encrusted with filth and fur, yet the sun shines off her clean, smooth blonde hair.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLesperance and Olseon are not interested in an archaic return to nature nor in a mokumentary-style “exposé,” but are ambiguous about the fantasy, longing and desire that mythic figures like Bigfoot elicit. Ancient rites are invoked without being explained. The two are shown after a kill in “Bigfoot &amp; Nioka V” (2005), with a dripping cow\'s head, bloody hatchet and all, yet their faces betray both horror and confusion. In another photo sticks have been arranged around tree trunks, presumably by the creature that slinks off in the background.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe photographs evidence an interest in a contemporary fixation on place. Shot in locations like the Pacific Northwest and New Mexico, they nevertheless seem to exist in the space between somewhere and nowhere—a forest that is somehow too foresty, a stage set of a forest. Is there such a thing as primitive camp? Lesperance and Oleson mix deadpan humor and sly wit into their serious set of references to ethnography, feminism, and romanticized landscapes. By referring back to 1970s feminist performance that also made recourse to the naked body for political purposes, Lesperance and Oleson remind us that it might have also been funny-funny-sharp, funny-wise- to witness Carolee Schneeman outline herself in large messy brushstrokes (“Interior Scroll,” 1975), or see Judy Chicago\'s photo of a women removing a bloody tampon (“Red Flag,” 1971).\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn “Bigfoot &amp; Nioka III” (2003/05), the two characters recline a field of brilliant green grass. The grotesquely besmirched Bigfoot sprawls out- it is unclear if she is resting injured. A gold band on her ring finger glints among the matted fur and smeared mud. The human mountain mama, in her rags and feathers, and stockings, gazes down at Bigfoot. The look in her eyes is pure tenderness; if this is theater, it is theater as revelation. That expression transcends both the fetishization of and disgust for all this female flesh and hair and dirt and blood. Lesperance and Oleson push beyond the usual dichotomy of ridicule and sincerity, and suffuse their work with a humor that coexists with a genuine affective change.\r\n<br><br><br>\r\n\r\nArtUS December 2005-February 2006\r\n<br><br>\r\nExhibition review: Monya Rowe Gallery, New York, NY, September 8-October 8, 2005\r\n',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(273,1,'2018-03-15 15:45:27','2020-11-24 01:31:59',NULL,'Eventâ€”CHANTAL?

There, she entered Maurice Gendron’s class at the Conservatoire National Supérieur. At 19, she crossed the iron curtain and went to live in Moscow, where she studied with Natalia Chakhovskaïa at the Tchaikovsky Conservatory. At 25, she returned to France where she won the Rostropovitch Competition. \r\n\r\nShe has performed as a soloist in a number of prestigious orchestras, notably: the Paris Orchestra, the French National Orchestra, the Belgian National Orchestra, the Liège Philharmonic, the Israel Philharmonia, the Gulbenkian Orchestra in Lisbon, the Philharmonic Orchestra of Luxembourg, the NDR Orchestra in Hanover, the REMIX Ensemble, Les Siècles, Asko/ Schönberg… and has worked regularly with musicians like Imogen Cooper and Raphaël Oleg. \r\n\r\nShe instigated a wide range of projects conceived as complete musical and visual experiences: Jewish songs, inspired by the art of the Hazzan; Songs of Slavic Lands, conceived as a journey from Russia to Central Europe; Vita, in which she tells the story of Angioletta-Angel via Monteverdi and Scelsi; Odyssey for Cello and Imaginary Choir, in which a woman, alone with her cello, accompanied by a soundtrack, faces the elements; Little Girl Blue, from Nina Simone.\r\n\r\nFor Wieder-Atherton, playing Bach, Beethoven, Jewish songs or Nina Simone involves a similar form of interrogation: what can/cannot be understood from a voice? She constantly pushes back boundaries, venturing into other artistic forms, with projects like From the East in Music, a show designed with footage from Chantal Akerman’s D’Est; and two collaboration with celebrated actresses: Night Dances, with Charlotte Rampling, featuring works by Benjamin Britten and Sylvia Plath, and Marguerite Duras’ Navire Night with Fanny Ardant. In 2017, she conceived and performed Exile, in collaboration with the theater/dance/choral troupe Compagnie Sans Père and the pianist Laurent Cabasso. \r\n	\r\nIn 2011, she received the Bernheim Foundation Award  and in 2015, she was named Chevalier de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANTAL AKERMAN \r\n\r\nWhen Chantal Akerman died on October 5, 2015, she left behind a prolific and singular oeuvre. A truly independent filmmaker, she used to write or co-write all her screenplays. She worked in a variety of formats, exploring both documentary, fiction and the personal essay form – in most than 60 works: 18 features, countless shorts and featurettes, and a dozen multiple-screen installations – always mixing high art with popular culture, minimalist rigor with physical exuberance. Through this multiplicity of formats, though, a unique tone, the specific quality of the gaze, an inimitable mastery of the mise en scène constituted a style that can be immediately spotted. \r\n\r\nBorn in Brussels in 1950, Akerman fell in love with cinema when she saw Godard’s Pierrot le fou as a teenager. At 18 she made her first short, the irreverent Saute Ma Ville (1968), and at 25, with Jeanne Dielman (1975), she became a household name, defining an era, and influencing filmmakers as different as Béla Tarr, Gus Van Sant and Nina Menkes.\r\n\r\nShe often appeared in her films, racing, meditating, writing, sleeping, stumbling into things, singing – a “female Charlie Chaplin,” she used to say. Her presence was the index of a novel way of performing femininity, queerness and the anguish felt by the children of Holocaust survivors. Hers was an unclassifiable body exploding the boundaries of sex, race, ethnicity, genre, language, and geography – at the border of the image, at the “border between documentary and fiction” – as an inimitable voice, the thinly melodious voice of a child, later made husky by the smoke of a thousand cigarettes.\r\n	\r\nSome of her most noted films include: Hotel Monterey (1972), Je, tu, il, elle (1974), News from Home (1976), Les Rendez-vous d’Anna (1978), Toute une nuit (1982), Golden Eighties (1986), Histoires d’Amérique (1986), D’Est (1993), Sud (1999), La Captive (2000), De l’autre côté (2002), Autour de Sonia Wieder-Atherton (2003), Demain on déménage (2005), Là-bas (2006), La Folie Almayer (2011) and No Home Movie (2015). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZena Zezza organized one of the most extensive surveys of Akerman’s films in LOOKING, REALLY LOOKING! “The Films of Chantal Akerman” co-presented with Northwest Film Center (June 17, 2016 – May 17, 2017). As part of its Chantal Akerman artist project season, Zena also produced five “Dialogues” events on the ideas and influences in Akerman’s artist practice with curators, historians, writers, actors and guests from other fields. \r\n',NULL),(280,1,'2019-01-16 15:59:13','2021-05-26 20:45:07',7,'Chantal?',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'chantal',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'A dialogue between a movie, a cello and a text',_binary 'Zena Zezza presents a live performance by Paris-based cellist Sonia Wieder-Atherton expressive of her enduring collaboration with filmmaker Chantal Akerman.\r\n<br><br>\r\nTuesday, May 1, 2018: 7pm <br>\r\nWednesday, May 2, 2018: 7pm<br>\r\nPNCA Mediatheque \r\n<br><br>\r\nWednesday, May 2, 2018: 5pm<br>\r\nSonia Wieder-Atherton in conversation with Sandra Percival <br>\r\nOregon Jewish Museum and Center for Holocaust Education\r\n<br><br>\r\nSonia Wieder-Atherton imagined CHANTAL? as a performance structured around an absence — the filmmaker Chantal Akerman (1950-2015), represented on stage by her first film and excerpts from one of her books —and a presence—the stellar cellist Sonia Wieder-Atherton, her companion and collaborator for many years, who \"imagined\" this dialogue: \r\n<br><br>\r\n“I wanted to play along with her, her every move, her silences, her dancing at once burlesque and deadly serious, her anxiety as she is humming little tunes.

In 2017, she conceived and performed Exile, in collaboration with the theater/dance/choral troupe Compagnie Sans Père and the pianist Laurent Cabasso. \r\n	\r\nIn 2011, she received the Bernheim Foundation Award  and in 2015, she was named Chevalier de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHANTAL AKERMAN \r\n\r\nWhen Chantal Akerman died on October 5, 2015, she left behind a prolific and singular oeuvre. A truly independent filmmaker, she used to write or co-write all her screenplays. She worked in a variety of formats, exploring both documentary, fiction and the personal essay form – in most than 60 works: 18 features, countless shorts and featurettes, and a dozen multiple-screen installations – always mixing high art with popular culture, minimalist rigor with physical exuberance. Through this multiplicity of formats, though, a unique tone, the specific quality of the gaze, an inimitable mastery of the mise en scène constituted a style that can be immediately spotted. \r\n\r\nBorn in Brussels in 1950, Akerman fell in love with cinema when she saw Godard’s Pierrot le fou as a teenager. At 18 she made her first short, the irreverent Saute Ma Ville (1968), and at 25, with Jeanne Dielman (1975), she became a household name, defining an era, and influencing filmmakers as different as Béla Tarr, Gus Van Sant and Nina Menkes.\r\n\r\nShe often appeared in her films, racing, meditating, writing, sleeping, stumbling into things, singing – a “female Charlie Chaplin,” she used to say. Her presence was the index of a novel way of performing femininity, queerness and the anguish felt by the children of Holocaust survivors. Hers was an unclassifiable body exploding the boundaries of sex, race, ethnicity, genre, language, and geography – at the border of the image, at the “border between documentary and fiction” – as an inimitable voice, the thinly melodious voice of a child, later made husky by the smoke of a thousand cigarettes.\r\n	\r\nSome of her most noted films include: Hotel Monterey (1972), Je, tu, il, elle (1974), News from Home (1976), Les Rendez-vous d’Anna (1978), Toute une nuit (1982), Golden Eighties (1986), Histoires d’Amérique (1986), D’Est (1993), Sud (1999), La Captive (2000), De l’autre côté (2002), Autour de Sonia Wieder-Atherton (2003), Demain on déménage (2005), Là-bas (2006), La Folie Almayer (2011) and No Home Movie (2015). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZena Zezza organized one of the most extensive surveys of Akerman’s films in LOOKING, REALLY LOOKING! “The Films of Chantal Akerman” co-presented with Northwest Film Center (June 17, 2016 – May 17, 2017). As part of its Chantal Akerman artist project season, Zena also produced six “Dialogues” events on the ideas and influences in Akerman’s artist practice with curators, historians, writers, actors and guests from other fields. \r\n',NULL),(283,1,'2019-06-22 20:22:24','2020-11-24 01:31:59',NULL,'Hans Coper',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'hans-coper',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Hans Coper',_binary 'HANS COPER: ARTIST PROJECT SEASON\r\nat the Oregon Jewish Museum and Center for Holocaust Education\r\nJune 6 – September 22, 2019\r\n\r\n\r\nHANS COPER—LESS MEANS MORE features the sculptural work of Hans Coper, a radical Jewish artist of the mid-twentieth century who was at the vanguard of British studio ceramics, pushing the boundaries of clay and forms of abstraction in his work. \r\n\r\nThe exhibition presents forty-five works by Coper from the late 1950s until the late 1970s, drawn from an extensive collection of his work in England’s York Art Gallery, significant works from a Portland collection, and related examples of his work from California and Iowa.

Coper pushed the boundaries of clay and forms of abstraction in his work, fusing the functional with the cultural with the symbolic.  Since 2013, Zena Zezza’s artist project seasons have featured artists such as Josiah McElheny, Stan Douglas and Chantal Akerman accompanied by a series of performative lectures and events on the ideas and influences in each artist’s practice. \r\n\r\nPercival is joined by artist Malia Jensen for a conversation on Coper’s work and the origins of his practice as a studio potter, first working with and sharing a studio with Lucie Rie from 1946 to 1958. Jensen’s father, Jay Jensen, was a studio potter in Oregon, thriving during the fertile art and craft scene of the 1970s. Malia Jensen’s work often combines raw and seductive materials, including clay, to call attention to the brutality and beauty of daily life. Central to her practice is a metaphorical exploration of the human condition. Jensen’s work has been exhibited nationally and internationally and she has been an Artist in Residence at the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation. Jensen is represented by Elizabeth Leach Gallery. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n',NULL),(298,1,'2020-08-13 15:39:14','2020-11-24 01:31:59',8,'Hans Coper',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'hans-coper',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Hans Coper','',NULL),(290,1,'2019-08-31 19:55:40','2020-11-24 01:31:59',NULL,'Hans Coper\'s Milieu: Collector W.A.

Ismay\r\nDr Helen Walsh, Curator of Ceramics, York Art Gallery, UK\r\n\r\nLESS MEANS MORE includes extensive representation of Hans Coper’s work from York Art Gallery’s collection which stems from a large gift in 2001 of 3,600 works of British studio ceramics from W. A. Ismay, the first collector of Coper’s work. Ismay was a public librarian who spent his earnings on buying British ceramics over 46 years and maintaining correspondence with many of the artists. His house was filled with pots and he had an obsessive and rigorous routine by which people could visit and view his collection. An artist was deemed highly significant if Ismay had collected 30 or more of their works. One was Hans Coper; another Lucie Rie. Walsh, who was doing her PhD and thesis at the time of cataloguing Ismay’s collection, will treat her subject “W.A.” as the protagonist of a story or a play that could well be fictional, if it weren’t indeed true and biographical. Ismay might be said to be the British equivalent of collectors, Dorothy and Herbert Vogel, the New York couple, one of whom was a postal clerk and the other a librarian, who over 45 years collected over 4,000 works of minimal and conceptual art which filled their one-bedroom New York apartment, later donated to the National Gallery of Art.\r\n\r\nWalsh’s talk will also focus on a selection of seminal British ceramic artists who were predecessors, peers or students of Coper. These figures and their work define some of the key aesthetic philosophies in the evolution of British studio pottery and its relationship to design and fine art. Walsh will highlight William Staite Murray (b. 1891) whose philosophy of ceramics was that of a pure art that connected painting and sculpture; Michael Cardew (b. 1901), acknowledged as Bernard Leach’s protégé, was very dismissive of Coper’s work (Leach eschewed Coper and Rie); Lucie Rie (1902) , a life-long friend and mentor who distinguished her work as a \"potter\" from Coper\'s as an \"artist; Ruth Duckworth (b. 1919), like Coper, was Jewish and left Germany for Britain, and later became a leading figure of American ceramics teaching at the University of Chicago;  Gordon Baldwin (b. 1932) embodied the dichotomy between the ‘vessel’ and ‘sculpture’ and had an interest in Surrealism and the music of Cage and Stockhausen; Elizabeth Fritsch (b. 1940) was a student of Coper’s at the Royal College of Art whose main interest was music; and Jan Godfrey, Ewan Henderson, and John Ward (students of Coper and Rie at Camberwell School of Art) who, at the end of the 20th century, represented the newer, post-Coper and Rie generation. \r\n\r\nDr Helen Walsh is the Curator of Ceramics at York Art Gallery UK where she established the Center for Ceramic Arts (CoCA) in 2015 and is in charge of contemporary British studio ceramics and the historical ceramics collection. She received her PhD at Manchester Metropolitan University and is currently working on a book and exhibition based on her research on collector W.A. Ismay and the post-war British studio pottery movement. \r\n \r\nPART 2: FILM SCREENING, 3-4pm\r\n\r\nCLAY FEVER, 2018. (42 mins.)\r\nProduced by York Theatre Royal in collaboration with York Art Gallery\r\n\r\n“Clay Fever’s” protagonists are a collector and an artist brought together in a performance based in the world of British studio pottery, which explores the long-lasting friendship and entertaining correspondence between collector W. A. Ismay and potter Michael Cardew. This theatrical production was commissioned by the York Art Gallery and produced by York Royal Theatre for the two-day international ceramics conference “Restating Clay” which was organized by the York Art Gallery in March 2018. The play was performed live for the conference audience and then later filmed being performed without an audience. “Clay Fever” portrays Michael Cardew and Ismay over the course of their 25-year friendship. The script was written by playwright Bridget Foreman and uses revealing and insightful dialogue from actual letters and conversations between Ismay and Cardew. Directed by Paul Burbridge, the actor Robert Pickavance takes the emotional role of potter Michael Cardew and actor Robin Simpson dons the beret and magnifying glass of collector Ismay. Starring alongside the actors are an array of pots from CoCA’s collection. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n',NULL),(291,1,'2019-08-31 20:08:26','2020-11-24 01:31:59',2,'Improvisation: Hans Coper, AMM & Cornelius Cardew',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'improvisation-hans-coper-amm-cornelius-cardew',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',_binary 'IMPROVISATION: HANS COPER, AMM & CORNELIUS CARDEW\r\nSunday, October 6, 2019, 3pm\r\nPNCA Mediatheque \r\n\r\n\r\nAs one of the most influential teachers at London’s Royal Academy of Art (RCA) from 1966 to 1976, Hans Coper’s impact was described as “gentle, yet shattering.” He more often than not took his students to a teashop and talked about jazz, noting that “improvisation” around a theme was part of his own practice. It was the 1960s and students were reacting to the cultural shifts in Britain towards radicalism and individuality. None made work like Coper. \r\n\r\nAround the beginning of Coper’s time at the RCA, guitarist and painter Keith Rowe and saxophonist Lou Gare had begun holding weekly open music sessions at the RCA, which gradually led to the formation of the group AMM with drummer Eddie Prevost and bassist Lawrence Sheaff. They were soon joined by experimental composer, musician, and graphic artist Cornelius Cardew, who was just completing work on his monumental graphic score Treatise. Cardew’s addition cemented AMM’s position at the nexus of new experimental music, jazz, and conceptual art. \r\n\r\nThe music of AMM and Cardew in the ‘60s balanced control and freedom, silence and noise, tangential jazz influences and the sounds of everyday life. It could be difficult to listen to. It could also be bracingly beautiful, dauntingly intellectual, spare and minimal—adjectives that could as easily describe the work of Hans Coper. \r\n\r\nPERFORMANCE\r\n\r\nMusicians/instruments:\r\n\r\nMatt Carlson, piano & electronics\r\nLee Elderton, saxophone\r\nMatt Hannafin, percussion\r\nCaspar Sonnet, lap steel dobro\r\n\r\nIn the mid-1960s, no AMM performance was ever planned; each was unique and spontaneous, with musicians following their own individual paths toward an unknown end. At the same time, Cornelius Cardew was creating purely graphic musical scores, with the intention that musicians should articulate their own understanding of the pieces rather than try to discern the composer’s intentions.\r\nThose two different but related performance tactics will be explored by the musicians in the performance. \r\n\r\nUsing theories, strategies, and aesthetics that had their beginnings with AMM and contemporaneous 1960s composers and musicians, the group will perform two extended improvisations: one using Hans Coper’s work as inspiration, one using select pages from Cardew’s graphic score \"Treatise.\" \r\n\r\n\r\nPOST PERFORMANCE DIALOGUE:  MATT HANNAFIN & MUSICIANS\r\nModerated by Whitney Lowe and Sandra Percival\r\n\r\nMatt Hannafin and the performing musicians will be joined by the moderators for a conversation and speculation on “improvisation.” How do we see and listen to the music of Cardew and AMM in relationship to the forms of Coper’s work? Could Coper’s shapes and textures be read as a score? Could their individual resonances be read as music? How does Coper’s focus on improvisation around a theme relate to jazz, and to AMM/Cardew’s extension into a more abstract improvisational sound world?\r\n\r\nMATT HANNAFIN (percussion) is a New York–born, Portland-based percussionist active in experimental music, improvisation, and Iranian classical and traditional music. His teachers included composer La Monte Young, Indian vocal master Pandit Pran Nath, Persian tar and tombak master Kavous Shirzadian, and percussionists Jamey Haddad, Glen Velez, Layne Redmond, and John Amira. He is the curator and director of Portland’s Extradition Series (www.extradition-series.com) and is also a professional writer and editor. www.matthannafin.com.\r\n\r\nWHITNEY LOWE is a renowned graphic designer, architect, and ceramic artist. He studied Architecture at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, received a BFA in Graphic Design & Packaging at Art Center College of Design, and a Post-Bacc in ceramics from Oregon College of Art and Craft. Lowe currently has an exhibition of ceramics, “Turbidity and the Peristaltic” on view at Froelick Gallery, September 3-October 12, 2019. \r\n\r\nCORNELIUS CARDEW (1933–1981) was an English experimental music composer and performer who was an assistant to Karlheinz Stockhausen from 1958 to 1960 and, in 1966, joined the free improvisation group AMM as cellist and pianist. He introduced the works of American experimental composers Morton Feldman, La Monte Young, Earle Brown, Christian Wolf, and John Cage to English audiences during the mid-sixties and came to have a considerable impact on the development of English music from the late sixties onward. Cardew’s most important score from his experimental period was Treatise (1963–67), a 193-page graphic score which allows near-absolute freedom of interpretation. Cornelius Cardew’s father was Michael Cardew (1901–1983), a British studio potter and protégé of Bernard Leach who described him as “one of the finest potters of the century.” \r\n\r\nHANS COPER (1920–1981) was a radical Jewish artist of the mid–twentieth century who was at the vanguard of British studio ceramics, pushing the boundaries of clay and forms of abstraction in his work. Coper pursued Bauhaus architect Mies van de Rohe’s maxim “less is more.” He was deeply influenced by ancient Greek and Roman art and shared an affinity with Giacometti and Brancusi. American minimalist artist Dan Flavin collected Coper’s work and dedicated nine all-white neon works to him in 1990. Coper’s work has recently been shown in Japan, New Zealand, and The Netherlands. \r\n\r\nEXTRADITION\r\nA programming arm of the Creative Music Guild, the Extradition Series (www.extradition-series.com) presents concerts and recitals that exist at the intersection of composition and improvisation, intentionality and chance, clarity and silence.

A. Ismay<br>\r\nDr Helen Walsh, Curator of Ceramics, York Art Gallery, UK\r\n<br><br>\r\nLESS MEANS MORE includes extensive representation of Hans Coper’s work from York Art Gallery’s collection which stems from a large gift in 2001 of 3,600 works of British studio ceramics from W. A. Ismay, the first collector of Coper’s work. Ismay was a public librarian who spent his earnings on buying British ceramics over 46 years and maintaining correspondence with many of the artists. His house was filled with pots and he had an obsessive and rigorous routine by which people could visit and view his collection. An artist was deemed highly significant if Ismay had collected 30 or more of their works. One was Hans Coper; another Lucie Rie. Walsh, who was doing her PhD and thesis at the time of cataloguing Ismay’s collection, will treat her subject “W.A.” as the protagonist of a story or a play that could well be fictional, if it weren’t indeed true and biographical. Ismay might be said to be the British equivalent of collectors, Dorothy and Herbert Vogel, the New York couple, one of whom was a postal clerk and the other a librarian, who over 45 years collected over 4,000 works of minimal and conceptual art which filled their one-bedroom New York apartment, later donated to the National Gallery of Art.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWalsh’s talk will also focus on a selection of seminal British ceramic artists who were predecessors, peers or students of Coper. These figures and their work define some of the key aesthetic philosophies in the evolution of British studio pottery and its relationship to design and fine art. Walsh will highlight William Staite Murray (b. 1891) whose philosophy of ceramics was that of a pure art that connected painting and sculpture; Michael Cardew (b. 1901), acknowledged as Bernard Leach’s protégé, was very dismissive of Coper’s work (Leach eschewed Coper and Rie); Lucie Rie (1902) , a life-long friend and mentor who distinguished her work as a \"potter\" from Coper\'s as an \"artist; Ruth Duckworth (b. 1919), like Coper, was Jewish and left Germany for Britain, and later became a leading figure of American ceramics teaching at the University of Chicago; Gordon Baldwin (b. 1932) embodied the dichotomy between the ‘vessel’ and ‘sculpture’ and had an interest in Surrealism and the music of Cage and Stockhausen; Elizabeth Fritsch (b. 1940) was a student of Coper’s at the Royal College of Art whose main interest was music; and Jan Godfrey, Ewan Henderson, and John Ward (students of Coper and Rie at Camberwell School of Art) who, at the end of the 20th century, represented the newer, post-Coper and Rie generation.\r\n<br><br>\r\nDr Helen Walsh is the Curator of Ceramics at York Art Gallery UK where she established the Center for Ceramic Arts (CoCA) in 2015 and is in charge of contemporary British studio ceramics and the historical ceramics collection. She received her PhD at Manchester Metropolitan University and is currently working on a book and exhibition based on her research on collector W.A. Ismay and the post-war British studio pottery movement.\r\n<br><br>\r\nPART 2: FILM SCREENING, 3-4pm\r\n<br><br>\r\nCLAY FEVER, 2018. (42 mins.)<br>\r\nProduced by York Theatre Royal in collaboration with York Art Gallery\r\n<br><br>\r\n“Clay Fever’s” protagonists are a collector and an artist brought together in a performance based in the world of British studio pottery, which explores the long-lasting friendship and entertaining correspondence between collector W. A. Ismay and potter Michael Cardew. This theatrical production was commissioned by the York Art Gallery and produced by York Royal Theatre for the two-day international ceramics conference “Restating Clay” which was organized by the York Art Gallery in March 2018. The play was performed live for the conference audience and then later filmed being performed without an audience. “Clay Fever” portrays Michael Cardew and Ismay over the course of their 25-year friendship. The script was written by playwright Bridget Foreman and uses revealing and insightful dialogue from actual letters and conversations between Ismay and Cardew. Directed by Paul Burbridge, the actor Robert Pickavance takes the emotional role of potter Michael Cardew and actor Robin Simpson dons the beret and magnifying glass of collector Ismay. Starring alongside the actors are an array of pots from CoCA’s collection.\r\n',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(307,1,'2020-08-14 14:51:04','2020-11-24 01:31:59',3,'Improvistation: Hans Coper, AMM and Cornelius Cardew',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'improvistation-hans-coper-amm-and-cornelius-cardew',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',_binary 'Improvistation: Hans Coper, AMM and Cornelius Cardew',NULL),(308,1,'2020-08-14 14:55:21','2020-11-24 01:31:59',3,'Improvisation: Hans Coper, AMM and Cornelius Cardew',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'improvisation-hans-coper-amm-and-cornelius-cardew',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Improvisation: Hans Coper, AMM and Cornelius Cardew','',NULL),(309,1,'2020-08-14 14:56:33','2021-05-26 20:50:38',3,'Improvisation: Hans Coper, AMM and Cornelius Cardew',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'improvisation-hans-coper-amm-and-cornelius-cardew',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Sunday, October 6, 2019, 3pm<br>\r\nPNCA Mediatheque\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nAs one of the most influential teachers at London’s Royal Academy of Art (RCA) from 1966 to 1976, Hans Coper’s impact was described as “gentle, yet shattering.” He more often than not took his students to a teashop and talked about jazz, noting that “improvisation” around a theme was part of his own practice. It was the 1960s and students were reacting to the cultural shifts in Britain towards radicalism and individuality. None made work like Coper.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAround the beginning of Coper’s time at the RCA, guitarist and painter Keith Rowe and saxophonist Lou Gare had begun holding weekly open music sessions at the RCA, which gradually led to the formation of the group AMM with drummer Eddie Prevost and bassist Lawrence Sheaff. They were soon joined by experimental composer, musician, and graphic artist Cornelius Cardew, who was just completing work on his monumental graphic score Treatise. Cardew’s addition cemented AMM’s position at the nexus of new experimental music, jazz, and conceptual art.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe music of AMM and Cardew in the ‘60s balanced control and freedom, silence and noise, tangential jazz influences and the sounds of everyday life. It could be difficult to listen to. It could also be bracingly beautiful, dauntingly intellectual, spare and minimal—adjectives that could as easily describe the work of Hans Coper.\r\n<br><br>\r\nPERFORMANCE\r\n<br><br>\r\nMusicians/instruments:\r\n<br><br>\r\nMatt Carlson, piano &amp; electronics<br>\r\nLee Elderton, saxophone<br>\r\nMatt Hannafin, percussion<br>\r\nCaspar Sonnet, lap steel dobro\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn the mid-1960s, no AMM performance was ever planned; each was unique and spontaneous, with musicians following their own individual paths toward an unknown end. At the same time, Cornelius Cardew was creating purely graphic musical scores, with the intention that musicians should articulate their own understanding of the pieces rather than try to discern the composer’s intentions.<br>\r\nThose two different but related performance tactics will be explored by the musicians in the performance.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUsing theories, strategies, and aesthetics that had their beginnings with AMM and contemporaneous 1960s composers and musicians, the group will perform two extended improvisations: one using Hans Coper’s work as inspiration, one using select pages from Cardew’s graphic score \"Treatise.\"\r\n<br><br><br>\r\n\r\nPOST PERFORMANCE DIALOGUE: MATT HANNAFIN &amp; MUSICIANS<br>\r\nModerated by Whitney Lowe and Sandra Percival\r\n<br><br>\r\nMatt Hannafin and the performing musicians will be joined by the moderators for a conversation and speculation on “improvisation.” How do we see and listen to the music of Cardew and AMM in relationship to the forms of Coper’s work? Could Coper’s shapes and textures be read as a score? Could their individual resonances be read as music? How does Coper’s focus on improvisation around a theme relate to jazz, and to AMM/Cardew’s extension into a more abstract improvisational sound world?\r\n<br><br>\r\nMATT HANNAFIN (percussion) is a New York–born, Portland-based percussionist active in experimental music, improvisation, and Iranian classical and traditional music. His teachers included composer La Monte Young, Indian vocal master Pandit Pran Nath, Persian tar and tombak master Kavous Shirzadian, and percussionists Jamey Haddad, Glen Velez, Layne Redmond, and John Amira. He is the curator and director of Portland’s Extradition Series (www.extradition-series.com) and is also a professional writer and editor. www.matthannafin.com.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWHITNEY LOWE is a renowned graphic designer, architect, and ceramic artist. He studied Architecture at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, received a BFA in Graphic Design &amp; Packaging at Art Center College of Design, and a Post-Bacc in ceramics from Oregon College of Art and Craft. Lowe currently has an exhibition of ceramics, “Turbidity and the Peristaltic” on view at Froelick Gallery, September 3-October 12, 2019.\r\n<br><br>\r\nCORNELIUS CARDEW (1933–1981) was an English experimental music composer and performer who was an assistant to Karlheinz Stockhausen from 1958 to 1960 and, in 1966, joined the free improvisation group AMM as cellist and pianist. He introduced the works of American experimental composers Morton Feldman, La Monte Young, Earle Brown, Christian Wolf, and John Cage to English audiences during the mid-sixties and came to have a considerable impact on the development of English music from the late sixties onward. Cardew’s most important score from his experimental period was Treatise (1963–67), a 193-page graphic score which allows near-absolute freedom of interpretation. Cornelius Cardew’s father was Michael Cardew (1901–1983), a British studio potter and protégé of Bernard Leach who described him as “one of the finest potters of the century.”\r\n<br><br>\r\nHANS COPER (1920–1981) was a radical Jewish artist of the mid–twentieth century who was at the vanguard of British studio ceramics, pushing the boundaries of clay and forms of abstraction in his work. Coper pursued Bauhaus architect Mies van de Rohe’s maxim “less is more.” He was deeply influenced by ancient Greek and Roman art and shared an affinity with Giacometti and Brancusi. American minimalist artist Dan Flavin collected Coper’s work and dedicated nine all-white neon works to him in 1990. Coper’s work has recently been shown in Japan, New Zealand, and The Netherlands.\r\n<br><br>\r\nEXTRADITION<br>\r\nA programming arm of the Creative Music Guild, the Extradition Series (www.extradition-series.com) presents concerts and recitals that exist at the intersection of composition and improvisation, intentionality and chance, clarity and silence.

Coper’s work fuses the functional with the cultural with the symbolic. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe exhibition presents forty-five works by Coper from the 1950s until the late 1970s, drawn from an extensive collection of his work in England’s York Art Gallery, significant works in a Portland collection, and related examples of his work from California and Iowa. Coper’s works in the exhibition are presented as a “Gesamtkunstwerk\" or “total work of art,” focusing on individual works and arrays of work, including his Ovoid, Spade, Thistle, and commanding Disc-shaped bottle on foot with indented front. These show Coper’s use of scale, form, and earthen hues, some burnished, some black. \r\n<br><br>\r\nHans Joachim Coper was born in 1920 in Chemnitz, Lower Saxony, Germany and died outside London in 1981. His Jewish father prospered as the manager of a textile mill until he was forced to resign after Hitler’s rise to power in 1933. In 1936, Coper’s father took his own life, believing that his death might save the family since Coper’s mother was not Jewish. Hans Coper left Germany for England as a Jewish refugee in early 1939. Shortly after his arrival, he was declared an enemy alien, arrested, and sent to a Canadian internment camp. He joined the Pioneer Corps of the British Army, which enabled him to return to England in 1941. \r\n<br><br>\r\nIn 1946, Coper found work with Jewish ceramicist Lucie Rie who had fled Nazi-occupied Austria in 1938. At Rie’s 18 Albion Mews studio, they worked side by side, making ceramic buttons, and later focused on the production of tableware, often signed together. In their work, Coper and Rie drew on the philosophy and practices of the Bauhaus and Wiener Werkstätte, both founded and active in early 20th century. It was their philosophy of melding art and craft that set Coper and Rie’s work apart from the mainstream British studio pottery movement. The exhibition also foregrounds Lucie Rie. A focused selection of Rie’s bowls, vases, and pots demonstrate her modernist and functional approach, along with her exaggerated shapes, elongated necks, and flared rims. She employed a wide range of surface treatments and glazes, including etched scrafitto lines and thick glazes with strong crackle. Rie also experimented with color—peacock blue, sage green, celadon, and gold—to dramatic, yet controlled effect.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn the late 1950s, Rie’s and Coper’s personal styles diverged: while hers remained functional, his became increasingly sculptural. In 1958, Coper left Lucie Rie’s studio to become an artist resident at Digswell Art Trust in Hertfordshire where he lived and worked until 1963. The vessels Coper created in the late 1950s at Digswell were often based on cylinder and chalice forms, many influenced by ancient Greek and Roman art which he spent hours studying at the British Museum. He also shared an affinity for Cycladic sculpture with two contemporary sculptors he admired, Giacometti and Brancusi. Coper’s Cycladic forms are tall and elongated, often appearing as an arrow, or piercing form with wings.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAt Digswell Coper struck up a life-long friendship with artist Donald Brook, a former student of Henry Moore. They spent long nights playing chess, drinking whiskey, and conversing on the philosophy of art and the Bauhaus, while waiting for the kiln to finish. This led to their life-long correspondence and occasional visits after Brook left Digswell for Australia, last seeing each other in 1976. \r\n<br><br>\r\nIn pursuit of Bauhaus architect Mies van de Rohe’s maxim “less is more,” Coper maintained a minimal set of materials and methods in creating his work—clay as material, the wheel at the core of generating form and, at times, the assembling of two or more thrown shapes with metal pins or rods. The presence of each form—whether a four-inch beaker or the seven-foot candlesticks he created for Coventry Cathedral—simultaneously projects an inherent modesty and monumentality. \r\n<br><br>\r\nHANS COPER—LESS MEANS MORE leads us to think more broadly about the work of Hans Coper within a contemporary art context by including the work of minimalist artist Dan Flavin, who was inspired by and collected work by Coper and Rie. In 1990, he created untitled (to Hans Coper, master potter), a series of nine all white neon light works, in addition to untitled (to Lucie Rie, master potter), a series in pink, yellow, and blue.  \r\n<br><br>\r\nThere are many silences surrounding artist Hans Coper. He neither returned to Germany nor spoke about his family story. As a teacher at the Royal College of Art in London from 1966 to 1976, Coper’s impact was described as “gentle yet shattering.” In individual tutorials with his students, he would question not what they were doing, but why. He more often than not took his students to a teashop and talked about jazz, noting that “improvisation” around a theme was part of his own practice. By 1979, suffering from Lou Gehrig’s disease, Coper had ceased working altogether and spent the last two years of his life alone in his studio, reading, writing in notebooks, and listening to music. Leaving his work to speak for itself, Coper had all his writings and letters destroyed upon his death in 1981. Similarly, Lucie Rie did not describe her work, nor share her life story. Rather, she welcomed people to her studio and served them tea. \r\n<br><br>\r\nJane Gate Coper, well-known photographer and later Coper’s wife, photographed his work over his lifetime. She framed her images of Coper’s pots to erase any reference to the functional in his work. Her photographs raise the stature of his work to the scale of the streetscape in London where they lived. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe Oregon Jewish Museum and Center for Holocaust Education’s exhibition space is more intimate than grand, more akin to the scale of domestic settings of private collections from which many museums have been gifted their collections of Coper and Rie. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe York Art Gallery’s Coper collection stems from a large gift in 2001 of over 3,600 works of British Studio ceramics from W.A. Ismay, the first collector of Coper’s work. The first work by Coper in Portland’s Shipley Collection was acquired after the collector visited the 1969 exhibition Peter Collingwood / Hans Coper at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. \r\n<br><br>\r\nHANS COPER—LESS MEANS MORE is the first presentation of Coper’s work on the west coast, following recent shows in New Zealand, Japan, and The Netherlands, and the first to take place in the US since the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s 1994 exhibition Lucie Rie/Hans Coper: Masterworks by Two British Potters in New York. In 2020, the York Art Gallery will mount a Hans Coper exhibition to celebrate the centennial of his birth in 1920.\r\n<br><br>\r\nHans Coper exhibited at the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam in 1953; won a Gold Medal at the Milan Triennale in 1954; and exhibited in New York in 1956. His work was shown and purchased for the collection of the Museum Boijmans van Beuningen in Rotterdam in 1967, and, posthumously, 1984 and 2014. Exhibitions also include:  1970 at the National Museum of Modern Art, Kyoto; 1980 at the Hetjens-Museum, Dusseldorf; 1984 at the Serpentine Gallery, 1985 at the Institute of Contemporary Art, and 1997 at the Barbican Art Gallery, London; 2009-2011, a Hans Coper retrospective featuring work from the York Art Gallery toured in Japan; and, most recently in 2018, Dan Flavin, to Lucie Rie and Hans Coper, master potters brought together Flavin’s 1990 neon series dedicated to Hans Coper and Lucie Rie with individual ceramic work by Coper and Rie at the Vito Schnabel Gallery, St. Moritz, Switzerland. \r\n',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(311,1,'2020-08-14 16:28:42','2021-05-26 17:06:01',2,'Thinking of Sculpture As Shaped by Space',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'thinking-of-sculpture-as-shaped-by-space',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'By Charles Ray',_binary 'In college I heard a story about Giacometti and Picasso walking down a decrepit street in Paris. Picasso, looking up at the ramshackle buildings, asked, \"How can these buildings possibly continue to stand?\"\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"Force of habit,\" Giacometti replied.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI found the comment hilarious, but as I grew older and began to struggle to get my own sculptures to stand, I started to wonder, \"What does the guy know that I don\'t?\"\r\n<br><br>\r\nSince then I\'ve kept coming back to Giacometti\'s work. With each return I get a new insight, a fresh experience, but also something harder to articulate: a sense that over time Giacometti began to convince space itself to shape and model his sculptures. That\'s an amazing feat. You can see what I mean starting on Thursday, when the Museum of Modern Art opens an exhibition of sculptures, drawings and paintings by Alberto Giacometti (1901-66). The show will include nearly 200 works from 1919 to 1965.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI first encountered Giacometti\'s sculpture on the cover of a paperback anthology of existentialist writing. It seemed appropriate. Here was an elongated burnt stick of a man pointing his bony finger at what I thought could only be the establishment that had dropped the bomb. This was in high school. In college I read the anthology, and then my art history teacher told me to note the figure\'s large weighty feet. This guy is earthbound, alone; he\'s not going to fly. He must be existential man.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI was told that Sartre and Giacometti were friends. One day I picked up an interview with Giacometti in which he was asked about an existential reading of his work. He replied, no, actually he was trying to make his figures as realistic as possible. What? To me, these figures were walking out of Dresden or Hiroshima.\r\n<br><br>\r\nHe went on to explain that when he looks at you he can\'t see all of you. He scans you, looking at your nose, then your lips, over your shoulder, then at your breast, belly and knees, all the way down the leg past your foot to the toes. As I recall, he said something like this:\r\n<br><br>\r\n\"We see parts of each other and we put them together. But if I want to see you in totality, you need to move away; we need space between us. Across the street I can see all of you at once, but then I also see this huge vista of space surrounding you, coming in and compressing you.\"\r\n<br><br>\r\nThis thought has never left me. And through it I began to see that rather than thinking about sculpture, one might be able to learn to think sculpturally.<br>\r\nOther interviews with Giacometti were equally confounding and enlightening. Once while looking at his \'\'Four Women on a Base\'\' I remembered reading an interview that took place in a hotel lobby. Giacometti was saying to a critic that the four beautiful women who had just entered the lobby could not be seen separately from the space the shiny marble floor generated between him and them.\r\n<br><br>\r\nI think Giacometti\'s sculptures somehow carry that space with them. To me, it\'s a kind of world space that we exist in. We can look at it in different ways. Biblically we were cast into it. \r\nArchitects talk about public and private space. Physicists connect space to time. Some scholars even see it as a construct. But when you look at Giacometti\'s \"Hands Holding the Void (Invisible Object),\" you realize that you will never know what space is, even though, just as you can touch the rectangular slab resting on the figure\'s feet, you can touch it, hold it and get lost in your relationship to it.\r\n<br><br>\r\nSmaller works like \"City Square,\" \"The Cage (Woman and Head)\" and some of the various small figures and busts are fantastic for their sculptural use of scale. Mediocre sculptures all have scale. They\'re really big, life-size, small or miniature. Good sculptures use a psychological yardstick rather than a physical one to measure scale. Great sculptures, like some of Giacometti\'s, have no scale. Rather, scale becomes one of the tools he uses to carve his work into our present space and time. When you look at a small Giacometti you never say, \"Oh! Look at the little guy. What a wonderful miniature.\" No. You say, \"This guy can sculpt!\" It\'s never big or small, it\'s always simply the right scale.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThis sounds elementary, but it\'s not. It\'s one of the essential ways he imbues his work with the life and breath of our real world. These works are not images you can read or understand -- they are alive, breathing, waiting for you to come and meet them. Check out \"The Palace at 4 A.M.\" Physically, this small work fits on the top of a pedestal, but later it grows and fills your mind. You can move through it and feel each and every bit of the urgency of its construction. It was made in 1932, but it feels as if it were made moments ago.\r\n<br><br>\r\nGiacometti shows us how to see from a sculptural point of view. A sculpture needs an armature the way a body needs its skeleton. Perhaps everything has an armature, thought being built around a kind of wire in the mind. Giacometti\'s use of armature was conventional until you understand that several bronzes were born from the clay on one twisted metal rod. After working for a day, a week or maybe a month, he would reach a point of satisfaction. Down the hall from his studio, his brother Diego worked as a furniture maker. Diego would take a plaster mold of the clay original and then use the mold to make a plaster duplicate while Giacometti returned to working on the clay original.\r\n<br><br>\r\nAt a certain point, Diego would make another mold and later another and perhaps another and another. The sculpture was in flux, and the plasters became a way to see it in time. Giacometti wasn\'t interested in the fact that the plasters froze the form but in the way the play of light on the surface of the plaster gave him alternative positions from which to view his work. I think this process is beautiful and can serve as an entrance into the work itself. It\'s so physical yet ephemerally spread out in time, like a thought growing in the mind.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWhen Giacometti worked, he could never articulate only one section of a piece. It was the whole or nothing. If he lost control of an arm, head or some other part, he could never fix it or work from there. He had to start again, bring it up from the ground as one whole form, just as he saw the completeness of a human figure from across a vista of space.\r\n<br><br>\r\nHe was once confronted with the fact that these figures across the street or on the far side of a cafe often come toward us, up to us and break down into their component parts of hands, noses, mouths and feet. Why didn\'t he deal with this more intimate aspect of figuration? His answer was something along these lines: \"Yes, people do come across the street to say hi, but as they approach and get near, my perception of space begins to dissolve, and a new interest takes over that is primarily emotional, and with it comes a desire to touch, which may be a human interest, but not the interest of my work.\"\r\n<br><br>\r\nThat\'s a powerful thought. Even the bust of Diego is Einsteinian, thin as a pancake when viewed from the front and squeezed out into space as you are drawn around it. The roughness of the surface never draws you in the way a blemish on your friend\'s face does. Look at the form and surface of all his mature figurative sculptures. They\'re stretched and pulled, rough but somehow never ragged or torn. In the end, all his figures, like the buildings on that dilapidated street he walked with Picasso, seem to stand by force of habit. Somehow with Giacometti, habit and other aspects of human psychology are embedded in his work the way the gravitational field is embedded in space.\r\n<br><br>\r\nNew York Times  October 7, 2001\r\n',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(312,1,'2020-08-15 10:40:18','2021-05-26 20:51:13',4,'Curator and Artist Tours and Conversations',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'curator-and-artist-tours-and-conversations',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Curator, Sandra Percival &amp; Artist, Malia Jensen',_binary 'Thursday, July 11, 4-5pm at OJMCHE\r\n<br><br>\r\nSandra Percival, founding Director and Curator of Zena Zezza will lead a tour of the exhibition featuring forty-five works of Hans Coper installed in a “Gesamttkunstwerk” or “total work of art” in conversation with Portland-based artist, Malia Jensen.

Minor White began his career in Oregon between the years of 1937 and 1942. In 1939, he began his employment with the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in Oregon, which was the largest agency and public works project of the New Deal-- a federally funded, programmatic response to the Great Depression. White was hired as a photographer with the Federal Art Project (FAP) in Oregon, which was a government-funded WPA program created with the intention to preserve by documentation the “unique and often vanishing features of each state.” The FAP predominantly employed painters and sculptors-- photography positions were rare. In 1952, a box of over 2,500 photographic negatives from the WPA was sent from Washington D.C. to Oregon’s Forestry Department and ended up in the basement of the Portland Art Museum’s library. Zena’s Minor White: 1857 Project presents for the first time ever a selection of images from the repositories of both institutions.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWhen White first arrives in Portland from Minneapolis in 1937, he lives at the YMCA and has a job as a night clerk at the Beverly Hotel. He joins the Oregon Camera Club, a group with traditional views on photography, mainly to access their facilities and learn the technicalities of the medium. In 1939, White is selected by the WPA to document some of Portland’s more than two hundred cast iron buildings in an effort to preserve the last signs of an urbanism that was disappearing at the hand of the many modernization projects that were occurring in the city at the time. Many of the cast iron buildings that White was assigned to photograph were located along Front Avenue and were slated for demolition in order to widen the street, which exists today as SW Naito Parkway. In addition to these architectural subjects, the majority of the photographs that White submits to the WPA pictures the activity along Portland’s waterfront. White photographs ships, grain elevators, logging activities, and transport by train and boat in a body of work that comprises his first completely autonomous photographic activity.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn 1940, White is sent by the WPA to the country town of La Grande, Oregon, population 8,000, located near the Idaho border and surrounded by wheat fields and wilderness. It is here that White is assigned to set up a community art center and teach photography. He also writes art criticism and is later promoted to director of the Grande Ronde Art Center. He continues to teach, document cultural events, write for the local paper and host a radio show during his 16 months in La Grande. White’s time here proved extremely important to his later career, as it was here that he first came to understand photography as much an artistic as a social medium.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWhite produces much of his independent photographic work in La Grande and surrounding locations in eastern Oregon, focusing mainly on the landscape and natural subjects. During the spring of 1941, and knowing next to nothing about the wilderness, he spends a week camping in the Wallowa Mountains where he rides horses and photographs the lake, mountain flowers and driftwood that had been there for centuries. Much of the territory that White visits at this time was country where no one had set foot. When the FAP funding to the art center stops in 1941, it is forced to shut down. Finding himself unemployed in remote country, White returns to Portland and gets a job in a department store playing Santa Claus.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe photographic explorations of the natural environment that White made in La Grande led to his first solo show at the Portland Art Museum in 1941, where 72 of his eastern Oregon photographs were shown. These Oregon photographs brought him national attention, and four of the photographs from the Portland Art Museum show went on to be shown at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWhite later went to San Francisco in 1946 to teach with Ansel Adams at the California School of Fine Arts (later known as the San Francisco Art Institute). In 1952, he went on to found Aperture magazine. White, a life-long educator, continued to return to Oregon over the next several decades where he continued to photograph and teach many classes and workshops. For the last ten years of his life, White taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and in 1970 was given a Guggenheim fellowship. Princeton University Art Museum holds the Minor White archives, and much more of his work is held in the collections of prominent museums around the country.\r\n<br><br>\r\nPrior to the Getty’s 2014 survey show of Minor White’s work, “Manifestations of the Spirit,” the last major solo show of his work was “Minor White: The Eye That Shapes” in 1989. The 1989 show, organized by the Princeton University Art Museum, opened at MoMA in New York and included a stop at the Portland Art Museum. Twenty five years have now passed since Minor White’s work has been celebrated in Portland, and most of the work included in the Minor White: 1857 Project from his time in eastern Oregon have not been seen since 1942. White is quoted as saying that his time in Oregon is when he discovered everything he wanted to do with photography; the rest of his career was spent refining and exploring those discoveries.\r\n',_binary '\r\n																								\r\n																								'),(313,1,'2020-08-15 10:43:15','2021-05-26 20:39:01',5,'1857 Project—Laura Heit',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'1857-projecta-laura-heit',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary '\r\n																								1857 Project—Laura Heit',_binary '\r\n																								',_binary '\r\n																								'),(315,1,'2020-08-15 15:11:49','2020-11-24 01:31:59',2,'Events',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'events',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Events','',NULL),(316,1,'2020-08-15 17:21:14','2020-11-24 01:31:59',1,'Images',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'images',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Images','',NULL),(317,1,'2020-08-15 17:29:29','2020-11-24 01:31:59',1,'Images',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'images',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Images','',NULL),(318,1,'2020-08-15 21:25:11','2021-05-26 20:48:58',NULL,'Gendered Work and DIY Making',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'gendered-work-and-diy-making',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,_binary 'Julia Bryan-Wilson&nbsp;in conversation with Jon Raymond',_binary 'Friday, April 20, 7pm<br>\r\nPNCA Bridge Lab<br>\r\nFree and open to the public\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nJulia Bryan-Wilson will discuss her research genealogies, including her formative years living in Portland as a DIY queer and feminist critic and curator.
